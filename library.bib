	abstract = {"Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain surveys the organization and function of the human nervous system. We present material at the cutting edge of neuroscience in a way that is accessible to both science and nonscience students alike. The level of the material is comparable to an introductory college text in general biology. The book is divided into four parts: Part I, Foundations; Part {II}, Sensory and Motor Systems; Part {III}, The Brain and Behavior; and Part {IV}, The Changing Brain. We begin Part I by introducing the modern field of neuroscience and tracing some of its historical antecedents. Then we take a close look at the structure and function of individual neurons, how they communicate chemically, and how these building blocks are arranged to form a nervous system. In Part {II}, we go inside the brain to examine the structure and function of the systems that serve the senses and command voluntary movements. In Part {III}, we explore the neurobiology of human behavior, including motivation, sex, emotion, sleep, language, attention, and mental illness. Finally, in Part {IV}, we look at how the environment modifies the brain, both during development and in adult learning and memory"--Provided by publisher},

	abstract = {1. Intracellular injections with horseradish peroxidasewere performed in cat alpha-motoneurones supplying various hind-limb muscles. 2. Ten alpha-motoneurones from each of the quadriceps, posterior biceps, gastrocnemius-soleus and anterior tibial pools as well as from the pool supplying the short plantar muscles were collected for morphological analysis of the intramedullary axonal systems including the recurrent axon collaterals. 3. The diameter of the alpha-motor axons showed considerable variation within each motoneurone pool, the total range being from 4.6 to 9.0 micrometer. No significant difference in mean axon diameter was obtained between the different pools. 4. All alpha-motoneurones supplying the short plantar muscles and one single alpha-motoneurone supplying the quadriceps muscle lacked collaterals completely, while the remaining motoneurones gave off one to five collaterals. 5. The number of axon collateral outbulgings, interpreted as synaptic boutons, wihch originated from a single alpha-motoneurone showed large variation within each pool that possessed axon collaterals, the total range being from seventeen of 158. The mean number varied from forty-four (quadriceps) to eighty-two (anterior tibial). 6. The axon collateral outbulgings were distributed not only in the Renshaw cell area ventromedial to the main motor nuclei but also in those parts of the motor nuclei which were located in the vicinity of the parent cell bodies. In the rostrocaudal direction, the outbulgings were distributed within a distances of less than 1 mm around the position of the parent cell bodies. 7. Some physiological implications of the lack of axon collaterals from alpha-motoneurones supplying the short plantar muscles were discussed in relation to the functional characteristics of plantar muscles and motor units.},

If the following remarks venture to devise for reflex inhibition yet another schema additional to the several existent, they do so with full recognition of the value and service of schemes already (4, 13, 14, 17, 22, 42) in the field. A complex problem, however, may be helped by offer of alternative suggestions. Dealing with the well-known schema originating from Keith Lucas (42), and developed with such notable advantage to the subject by Adrian and Forbes, Adrian himself has very recently (4) summarised the present position of the problem and main views obtaining on it. Here, therefore, it may be permitted to proceed without further preface to the scheme which it is sought to offer for consideration.},
