	abstract = {Effects on single lumbar gamma-motoneurones, mediated via fibres running in the ventral roots, were studied by micro-electrode recording in cats anaesthetized with chloralose. Graded electrical stimulation of ventral roots or of peripheral nerves was used. The cells were identified as gamma-motoneurones by antidromic stimulation and by measurement of their axonal conduction velocity. Some of the cells were classified as static or dynamic. The findings confirm the previously demonstrated existence of low-threshold, presumed recurrent, inhibition of both static and dynamic gamma-motoneurones. Strong evidence for the occurrence of high-threshold recurrent inhibition of gamma-motoneurones is also presented. In addition, excitatory effects on gamma-cells, also mediated via fibres in the ventral roots, are described. The low-threshold effects from ventral root fibres are attributed to recurrent alpha-collateral activity and the high-threshold effects to gamma-collateral activity. The significance of recurrent inhibition of gamma-motoneurones is discussed in relation to the ‘gain regulator’ concept proposed by Hultborn, Lindström \& Wigström (1979).},

We present material at the cutting edge of neuroscience in a way that is accessible to both science and nonscience students alike. The level of the material is comparable to an introductory college text in general biology. The book is divided into four parts: Part I, Foundations; Part {II}, Sensory and Motor Systems; Part {III}, The Brain and Behavior; and Part {IV}, The Changing Brain. We begin Part I by introducing the modern field of neuroscience and tracing some of its historical antecedents. Then we take a close look at the structure and function of individual neurons, how they communicate chemically, and how these building blocks are arranged to form a nervous system. In Part {II}, we go inside the brain to examine the structure and function of the systems that serve the senses and command voluntary movements. In Part {III}, we explore the neurobiology of human behavior, including motivation, sex, emotion, sleep, language, attention, and mental illness. Finally, in Part {IV}, we look at how the environment modifies the brain, both during development and in adult learning and memory"--Provided by publisher},

Ten alpha-motoneurones from each of the quadriceps, posterior biceps, gastrocnemius-soleus and anterior tibial pools as well as from the pool supplying the short plantar muscles were collected for morphological analysis of the intramedullary axonal systems including the recurrent axon collaterals. 3. The diameter of the alpha-motor axons showed considerable variation within each motoneurone pool, the total range being from 4.6 to 9.0 micrometer. No significant difference in mean axon diameter was obtained between the different pools. 4. All alpha-motoneurones supplying the short plantar muscles and one single alpha-motoneurone supplying the quadriceps muscle lacked collaterals completely, while the remaining motoneurones gave off one to five collaterals. 5. The number of axon collateral outbulgings, interpreted as synaptic boutons, wihch originated from a single alpha-motoneurone showed large variation within each pool that possessed axon collaterals, the total range being from seventeen of 158. The mean number varied from forty-four (quadriceps) to eighty-two (anterior tibial). 6. The axon collateral outbulgings were distributed not only in the Renshaw cell area ventromedial to the main motor nuclei but also in those parts of the motor nuclei which were located in the vicinity of the parent cell bodies. In the rostrocaudal direction, the outbulgings were distributed within a distances of less than 1 mm around the position of the parent cell bodies. 7. Some physiological implications of the lack of axon collaterals from alpha-motoneurones supplying the short plantar muscles were discussed in relation to the functional characteristics of plantar muscles and motor units.},

The degree of recurrent inhibition of tonically firing alpha- and gamma-motoneurones to triceps surae muscles was assessed in decerebrated cats by measuring the change in probability of firing caused by an antidromic volley in other motoneurone axons. 2. In nine cats 91\% (thirty-one out of thirty-three) of alpha- and 54\% (twenty-five out of forty-six) of gamma-motoneurones could be inhibited by antidromic volleys in alpha-motoneurone axons. 3. The degree of recurrent inhibition, expressed as the average reduction in probability of firing during the response, was typically in the range of 59-95\% for alpha-motoneurones compared to 20-85\% for gamma-motoneurones. 4. The duration of recurrent inhibition was 20-50 msec for alpha-motoneurones and 5-40 msec for gamma-motoneurones. The duration was dependent upon the frequency of firing of a neurone, being shorter at high frequencies than at low frequencies. When alpha- and gamma-motoneurones had similar frequencies of discharge the durations of their recurrent inhibition were comparable. 5. Raising the strength of electrical stimulation to elicit an antidromic volley in gamma- as well as alpha-motoneurone axons never produced or increased recurrent inhibition in either type of motoneurone. 6. The quantitative differences in recurrent inhibition of alpha- and gamma-motoneurones are discussed in relation to the control of firing frequency.},

	isbn = {978-0-7360-6679-2},
	abstract = {Drawing on the disciplines of neurophysiology and physics, Neuromechanics of Human Movement, Fourth Edition, explores how the nervous system controls the actions of muscles to produce human motion in relation to biomechanical principles. This contemporary approach is much different from the traditional approach, which focuses solely on mechanics and does not consider the role of the sensory system in the control of human movement. Neuromechanics of Human Movement, Fourth Edition, provides a scientific foundation to the study of human movement, and as such it uses precise terms and definitions when discussing ideas and utilizing the international metric system (SI). Readers will find an appendix that helps in identifying the SI metric units as well as other learning tools, including a glossary of terms and two other appendixes that cover conversion factors and equations. Throughout the text, the content is visually reinforced with more than 750 illustrations, many of which are new or upgraded from the previous edition and include specific illustrations of the neuromechanics involved in sport and rehabilitation movements. Finally, the text contains more than 1,500 updated references and suggested reading lists for each chapter.To further enhance this fourth edition, significant content updates have been made to ensure the latest information is presented for both research and clinical environments:-New coverage regarding electromyography (EMG) that demonstrates the connection between the nervous system and the muscle by measuring the activation signal, allowing readers to better understand how motion is activated-Additional examples that underscore recent research developments in reaching and grasping activities for rehabilitation -In-depth coverage of the motor system that addresses excitable membranes, muscle and motor units, and voluntary movement-Expanded discussion of neuromuscular system adaptations to the aging process -Neuromuscular system adaptations with particular application to rehabilitation To encourage a comprehensive learning experience, this updated edition follows a logical progression where each part builds on the material from the previous section. It begins with an introduction to the biomechanical terms and concepts commonly used to describe movement, focusing on the relation between force and motion. Once readers have grasped the basic laws of motion, the text continues by considering the essential neurophysiological concepts that help to explain movement produced by the nervous system and muscle. The author uses a “bottom-up” approach for this explanation that begins with the principles of electricity and extends up to connections within the cerebral cortex. This approach encompasses the essentials of electricity responsible for the excitability of cell membranes and explains the relations between spinal neurons and muscle fibers. The third and final part of the text concludes by describing the ways in which the motor system adapts to various types of physical stress. These adapative capabilities include altering core temperature, phenomena such as strength and power training, adaptations that occur after periods of reduced activity, motor recovery from injury; and changes that occur with aging. Readers will understand how acute adjustments can be made to the motor system through interventions such as warm-up, flexibility, muscle soreness, and muscle fatigue. The fourth edition of Neuromechanics of Human Movement provides a scientific basis for the study of human movement while continuing to expand current knowledge in the fields of biomechanics and neurophysiology. By integrating these fields in a unique framework, this text offers professionals and students both valuable clinical information and inspiration to deepen their study of human movement.},

The effects of impulses in recurrent motor axon collaterals on reflex transmission from different types of primary afferents to motoneurones were investigated in the cat by conditioning of PSPs evoked in motoneurones., 2.

Some IPSPs from group II muscle afferents and low threshold cutaneous afferents were also slightly depressed, while other PSPs were unaffected., 3. The depression of the IPSPs could be evoked by antidromic volleys, which produced neither conductance changes in the motoneurones nor depolarization of Ia afferent terminals., 4. The effect on the Ia IPSPs is most likely due to post-synaptic inhibition of the Ia inhibitory interneurones, evoked through α-motor axon collaterals and Renshaw cells. The depression of some IPSPs from flexor reflex afferents is explained by a convergence of excitatory effects from these afferents on the Ia inhibitory interneurones., 5.

Differential blocking of larger fibers in the nerve was successfully obtained by applying trapezoid wave current to the nerve. 2. It was shown that more than half (58.1\%) of the Renshaw cells receive homogeneous inputs from a motor axon collaterals, 25.8\% of the cell receive collateral inputs from a certain group of fibers, and 12.5\% of the Renshaw cells were activated by “γ range” fibers.},

Intact cats, under either barbiturate or chloralose anesthesia with gallamine triethiodide for complete neuromuscular paralysis, were used. While monitoring antidromically driven Renshaw cells with extracellular microelectrodes, supraspinal structures were stimulated using the stereotaxic technique. The Renshaw cell discharge could be attenuated and even completely blocked by preceding weak central stimulation by conditioning testing of certain brain-stem and thalamic areas. The sensitivity of this important segmental inhibitory interneuron of the alpha motor system to supraspinal influences introduces an additional regulatory system that must be considered in a formulation of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the various clinical syndromes.},

	doi = {10.1007/BF00585405},
	abstract = {1. The contraction of limb extensor muscles during side-down roll tilt of the animal depends upon an increased discharge of excitatory vestibulospinal (VS) neurons (α-response) and a reduced discharge of inhibitory reticulospinal (RS) neurons of the medulla (β-response), both acting on ipsilateral limb extensor motoneurons. In the decerebrate cat, a modulation of the multiunit EMG activity was clearly present in forelimb extensors, but was extremely weak or absent in hindlimb extensors. 2. Experiments performed in decerebrate cats with the deefferented GS muscle fixed at a constant length have shown that Renshaw (R)-cells, monosynaptically coupled with gastrocnemius-soleus (GS) motoneurons, were either unresponsive or displayed only very weak, small amplitude α-responses to sinusoidal stimulation of labyrinth receptors elicited during slow head rotation after bilateral neck deafferentation. This effect was attributed to excitatory VS volleys acting on GS motoneurons and, through their recurrent collaterals, on the related R-cells. In these instances the recurrent inhibition of the GS motoneurons contributed to the very low gain of the EMG response of the corresponding muscles to labyrinth stimulation. 3. Intravenous injection of an anticholinesterase (eserine sulphate, 0.05–0.1 mg/kg) at a dose that in previous experiments increased the firing rate of medullary RS neurons, while decreasing the decerebrate rigidity, slightly increased the discharge rate of R-cells linked with the GS motoneurons in the animal at rest; these findings suggest that the RS system inhibits the extensor motoneurons by exciting the related R-cells. All the R-cells, which prior to the injection were either unresponsive or showed an α-response to head rotation (at 0.026–0.15 Hz, ±10°), after eserine sulphate showed a β-response for the same parameters of labyrinth stimulation. In particular, a reduced discharge of the R-cells linked with the GS motoneurons occurred during side-down head rotation as shown for the majority of the RS neurons. It appears therefore that the same R-cells, which in the normal decerebrate cat responded to the excitatory VS volleys acting through the GS motoneurons, were now decoupled from their input motoneurons during head rotation, thus behaving as if they underwent the most efficient direct excitatory control of the RS system. The reduced discharge of the R-cells linked with the GS motoneurons during side-down head rotation would lead to disinhibition of these motoneurons, thus enhancing the response gain of the corresponding muscle to labyrinth stimulation. 4. This hypothesis was supported by the results of electromyographic experiments showing that the modulation of the multiunit activity of the GS muscle, which in normal decerebrate cats was negligible or extremely poor in amplitude, greatly increased after injection of the same dose of anticholinesterase. 5. We postulate that the inhibitory RS system, which is under the tonic excitatory control of a cholinergic system, operates through the R-cells as a variable gain regulator, acting at the motoneuronal level during the vestibular reflexes. The results of the present experiments support the general hypothesis on the function recently attributed to the recurrent inhibitory circuit in the spinal cord.},

If the following remarks venture to devise for reflex inhibition yet another schema additional to the several existent, they do so with full recognition of the value and service of schemes already (4, 13, 14, 17, 22, 42) in the field. A complex problem, however, may be helped by offer of alternative suggestions. Dealing with the well-known schema originating from Keith Lucas (42), and developed with such notable advantage to the subject by Adrian and Forbes, Adrian himself has very recently (4) summarised the present position of the problem and main views obtaining on it. Here, therefore, it may be permitted to proceed without further preface to the scheme which it is sought to offer for consideration.},

Starting with a simple model of the neuron as an electrical circuit, gradually more details are added to include the effects of neuronal morphology, synapses, ion channels and intracellular signaling. The principle of abstraction is explained through chapters on simplifying models, and how simplified models can be used in networks. This theme is continued in a final chapter on modeling the development of the nervous system. Requiring an elementary background in neuroscience and some high school mathematics, this textbook is an ideal basis for a course on computational neuroscience.},

The size of the cell bodies of the motoneurones, and the diameters of their intramedullary axons, were related to their axonal conduction velocities over the whole range studied. 3. Despite the smaller size of the cell bodies of the γ-motoneurones, their dendritic trees extended as far as those of the α-motoneurones. However, γ-motoneurones had fewer main dendrites than the α-motoneurones and these branched much less, so that the dendritic trees of the γ-motoneurones were much simpler than those of α-motoneurones. Although the extents of the dendritic trees were not related to axonal conduction velocity, the complexity of the dendritic trees was clearly related to axonal conduction velocity and to cell body size. 4. The total surface area of each cell, taken as an indication of the area available for synaptic contact, was much smaller for γ- than for α-motoneurones, and was related to axonal conduction velocity. 5. Only one of the seven γ-motoneurones studied had axon collaterals whereas five of the nine α-motoneurones had well developed collaterals. This finding is consistent with the relative contribution that each group of motoneurone axons makes to recurrent inhibition. 6. One of the γ-motoneurones had two axons, of different diameter, which emerged from the spinal cord at the same level but in different ventral rootlets. 7. These features of motoneurone structure are related to aspects of their physiological properties.},
