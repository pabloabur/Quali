	abstract = {Cross-correlation histograms (CCH) were computed for discharge sequences of pairs of motoneurones which were excited by sinusoidal muscle stretches. These CCH's were compared before and after opening of the recurrent inhibitory loop by Renshaw cell blocking agents. Periodic patterns in the CCH's indicative of specifically timed phase relations between discharges of different motoneurones were enhanced after Renshaw cell blockage. This was confirmed by power spectra computed for the CCH's. They contained power peaks about 50Hz which tended to increase after depression of recurrent inhibition. The correlation was thus due predominantly to line current interference which seemed to act as a common entrainment input at the spinal level. It is concluded that Renshaw cells de-correlate discharge patterns of different motoneurones of the same pool by injecting uncorrelated signals into them. This de-correlation is an important prerequisite for distortion suppression of signal transmission in a multi-channel system, like that of stretch reflex, and for its linearization.},

	abstract = {Objective . Computational models often require tradeoffs, such as balancing detail with efficiency; yet optimal balance should incorporate sound design features that do not bias the results of the specific scientific question under investigation. The present study examines how model design choices impact simulation results. Approach . We developed a rigorously-validated high-fidelity computational model of the spinal motoneuron pool to study three long-standing model design practices which have yet to be examined for their impact on motoneuron recruitment, firing rate, and force simulations. The practices examined were the use of: (1) generic cell models to simulate different motoneuron types, (2) discrete property ranges for different motoneuron types, and (3) biological homogeneity of cell properties within motoneuron types. Main results . Our results show that each of these practices accentuates conditions of motoneuron recruitment based on the size principle, and minimizes conditions of mixed and reversed recruitment orders, which have been observed in animal and human recordings. Specifically, strict motoneuron orderly size recruitment occurs, but in a compressed range, after which mixed and reverse motoneuron recruitment occurs due to the overlap in electrical properties of different motoneuron types. Additionally, these practices underestimate the motoneuron firing rates and force data simulated by existing models. Significance . Our results indicate that current modeling practices increase conditions of motoneuron recruitment based on the size principle, and decrease conditions of mixed and reversed recruitment order, which, in turn, impacts the predictions made by existing models on motoneuron recruitment, firing rate, and force. Additionally, mixed and reverse motoneuron recruitment generated higher muscle force than orderly size motoneuron recruitment in these simulations and represents one potential scheme to increase muscle efficiency. The examined model design practices, as well as the present results, are applicable to neuronal modeling throughout the nervous system.},

	abstract = {Effects on single lumbar gamma-motoneurones, mediated via fibres running in the ventral roots, were studied by micro-electrode recording in cats anaesthetized with chloralose. Graded electrical stimulation of ventral roots or of peripheral nerves was used. The cells were identified as gamma-motoneurones by antidromic stimulation and by measurement of their axonal conduction velocity. Some of the cells were classified as static or dynamic. The findings confirm the previously demonstrated existence of low-threshold, presumed recurrent, inhibition of both static and dynamic gamma-motoneurones. Strong evidence for the occurrence of high-threshold recurrent inhibition of gamma-motoneurones is also presented. In addition, excitatory effects on gamma-cells, also mediated via fibres in the ventral roots, are described. The low-threshold effects from ventral root fibres are attributed to recurrent alpha-collateral activity and the high-threshold effects to gamma-collateral activity. The significance of recurrent inhibition of gamma-motoneurones is discussed in relation to the ‘gain regulator’ concept proposed by Hultborn, Lindström \& Wigström (1979).},

The book is divided into four parts: Part I, Foundations; Part {II}, Sensory and Motor Systems; Part {III}, The Brain and Behavior; and Part {IV}, The Changing Brain. We begin Part I by introducing the modern field of neuroscience and tracing some of its historical antecedents. Then we take a close look at the structure and function of individual neurons, how they communicate chemically, and how these building blocks are arranged to form a nervous system. In Part {II}, we go inside the brain to examine the structure and function of the systems that serve the senses and command voluntary movements. In Part {III}, we explore the neurobiology of human behavior, including motivation, sex, emotion, sleep, language, attention, and mental illness. Finally, in Part {IV}, we look at how the environment modifies the brain, both during development and in adult learning and memory"--Provided by publisher},

	abstract = {Spike-frequency adaptation is a prominent feature of neural dynamics. Among other mechanisms, various ionic currents modulating spike generation cause this type of neural adaptation. Prominent examples are voltage-gated potassium currents (M-type currents), the interplay of calcium currents and intracellular calcium dynamics with calcium-gated potassium channels (AHP-type currents), and the slow recovery from inactivation of the fast sodium current. While recent modeling studies have focused on the effects of specific adaptation currents, we derive a universal model for the firing-frequency dynamics of an adapting neuron that is independent of the specific adaptation process and spike generator. The model is completely defined by the neuron's onset f-I curve, the steady-state f-I curve, and the time constant of adaptation. For a specific neuron, these parameters can be easily determined from electrophysiological measurements without any pharmacological manipulations. At the same time, the simplicity of the model allows one to analyze mathematically how adaptation influences signal processing on the single-neuron level. In particular, we elucidate the specific nature of high-pass filter properties caused by spike-frequency adaptation. The model is limited to firing frequencies higher than the reciprocal adaptation time constant and to moderate fluctuations of the adaptation and the input current. As an extension of the model, we introduce a framework for combining an arbitrary spike generator with a generalized adaptation current.},

	abstract = {1. The patterns of medial gastrocnemius (MG) motor unit firing in response to MG muscle stretch have been studied in decerebrate cats, using intracellular recording techniques. In most of the units, the motoneurone axonal conduction velocity and cell input resistance were measured, and the maximum amplitude and wave form of the group Ia composite EPSP evoked by MG nerve stimulation were determined. The mechanical properties of the muscle unit portion of each motor unit were also studied. 2. Motor unit firing patterns were classified into two groups, ‘tonic’ and ‘phasic’. With few exceptions, tonic motor units showed sustained firing throughout MG stretches of varying duration, while most phasic units did not fire at all to the same stimulus. Tetanization of the afferents did not convert any of the previously phasic units to tonic firing. 3. MG motor units in this study were divided into three groups on the basis of the muscle unit twitch properties. Units with short twitch time to peak values ({\textless} 35 msec) were subdivided into two groups according to twitch tension output: (a) type F, with twitch tension {\textgreater} 1·5 g, and (b) type F*, with twitch tension {\textless} 1·5 g. Units with slow twitch time to peak ({\textgreater} 35 msec) were classified as type S. 4. The presence or absence of tonic firing during sustained MG stretch was found to be significantly related to the following factors: (a) the motor unit twitch type, in that tonic firing was observed in 100\% of type S, 70\% of type F*, and only 10\% of type F units; (b) the apparent motoneurone size, in that tonic units tended to have higher cell input resistance values and slower axonal conduction velocities than phasic units; and (c) the density and spatial organization of the group Ia synaptic input, in that the MG monosynaptic EPSPs found in tonic motor units tended to be both larger in amplitude and longer in duration than those found in phasic units. 5. The intrinsic properties of MG motor units, the characteristics of the group Ia synaptic input to the motoneurones and the unit firing patterns elicited by MG muscle stretch appear to be mutually interrelated, forming a pattern of motor units within the MG pool which is analogous to the pattern thought to characterize the motor units belonging to ‘slow’ and ‘fast’ muscles. In most respects this pattern of MG motor units appears to be a continuum without clearly separable subgroups.},

Renshaw cells were identified by their characteristic expression patterns of gephyrin immunoreactivity in sections of rat and cat lumbar spinal cord. In the rat, all neurons classified as Renshaw cells (n = 487) also contained calbindin D28k-immunoreactivity, and all calbindin D28k-immunoreactive cells located in the ventral-most region of lamina VII expressed the characteristic gephyrin labeling and morphology of Renshaw cells. In the cat, fewer than half of the Renshaw cells (47\%; n = 128) were double-labeled. In both species, occasional calbindin D28k-immunoreactive Renshaw cells were identified within motor nuclei in lamina IX. The distinctive immunolabeling of Renshaw cells allowed us to estimate that there are about 250 Renshaw cells in each ventral horn of the fourth lumbar segment of rat spinal cord, and about 750 cells per ventral horn in the L6 segment of the cat. We conclude that the functional properties of Renshaw cells, including their ability to fire action potentials at high rates, likely require specific homeostatic mechanisms including strong intracellular calcium buffering, the precise mechanisms of which may vary between species.},

The tendency to saturate is independent of the number of motor axons exciting a Renshaw cell. On average, the stimulus frequency at which the discharge rate reaches half its saturation value lies between 10 and 15 Hz. The effect of Renshaw cell activity — measured as the antidromic inhibition of individual α-motoneurons — reflects the form of the static frequency characteristics. An electric circuit analog of the Renshaw cell membrane is presented which serves to explain the qualitative features of the static input-output relations; the nonlinearity is the result of synapses with linear properties acting together at the cell membrane.},

Ten alpha-motoneurones from each of the quadriceps, posterior biceps, gastrocnemius-soleus and anterior tibial pools as well as from the pool supplying the short plantar muscles were collected for morphological analysis of the intramedullary axonal systems including the recurrent axon collaterals. 3. The diameter of the alpha-motor axons showed considerable variation within each motoneurone pool, the total range being from 4.6 to 9.0 micrometer. No significant difference in mean axon diameter was obtained between the different pools. 4. All alpha-motoneurones supplying the short plantar muscles and one single alpha-motoneurone supplying the quadriceps muscle lacked collaterals completely, while the remaining motoneurones gave off one to five collaterals. 5. The number of axon collateral outbulgings, interpreted as synaptic boutons, wihch originated from a single alpha-motoneurone showed large variation within each pool that possessed axon collaterals, the total range being from seventeen of 158. The mean number varied from forty-four (quadriceps) to eighty-two (anterior tibial). 6. The axon collateral outbulgings were distributed not only in the Renshaw cell area ventromedial to the main motor nuclei but also in those parts of the motor nuclei which were located in the vicinity of the parent cell bodies. In the rostrocaudal direction, the outbulgings were distributed within a distances of less than 1 mm around the position of the parent cell bodies. 7. Some physiological implications of the lack of axon collaterals from alpha-motoneurones supplying the short plantar muscles were discussed in relation to the functional characteristics of plantar muscles and motor units.},

Although recent decades have witnessed numerous discoveries that have shed light into various properties of this system, the basic principles underlying its overall operation still remain poorly understood. In this article, Carlo J. De Luca and Zeynep Erim discuss the concept of common drive of motor units that provides a possible scheme for the control of motor units, unifying various seemingly isolated findings that have been reported. According to this concept, a pool of motor units that makes up a muscle is controlled collectively during a contraction of that muscle. The unique firing patterns of individual motor units are effected, not by separate command signals sent to these units, but by one common drive to which motor units respond differently. The specific architecture of the system and the orderly gradation in the inherent properties of individual elements enable a single source to control the activities of all the motor units in a given pool. Such an arrangement relieves the CNS from the burden of monitoring and regulating each motor unit separately.},

	abstract = {Muscle force is modulated by varying the number of active motor units and their firing rates. For the past five decades, the notion that the magnitude of the firing rates is directly related to motor unit size and recruitment threshold has been widely accepted. This construct, here named the After-hyperpolarization scheme evolved from observations in electrically stimulated cat motoneurons and from reported observations in voluntary contractions in humans. It supports the assumption that the firing rates of motor units match their mechanical properties to “optimize” force production, so that the firing rate range corresponds to that required for force-twitch fusion (tetanization) and effective graduation of muscle force. In contrast, we have shown that, at any time and force during isometric voluntary constant-force contractions in humans, the relationship between firing rate and recruitment threshold is inversely related. We refer to this construct as the Onion-Skin scheme because earlier-recruited motor units always have greater firing rates than latter-recruited ones. By applying a novel mathematical model that calculates the force produced by a muscle for the two schemes we found that the Onion-Skin scheme is more energy efficient, provides smoother muscle force at low to moderate force levels, and appears to be more conducive to evolutionary survival than the After-hyperpolarization scheme.},

	abstract = {Several models have been employed to study human postural control during upright quiet stance. Most have adopted an inverted pendulum approximation to the standing human and theoretical models to account for the neural feedback necessary to keep balance. The present study adds to the previous efforts in focusing more closely on modelling the physiological mechanisms of important elements associated with the control of human posture. This paper studies neuromuscular mechanisms behind upright stance control by means of a biologically based large-scale neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) model. It encompasses: i) conductance-based spinal neuron models (motor neurons and interneurons); ii) muscle proprioceptor models (spindle and Golgi tendon organ) providing sensory afferent feedback; iii) Hill-type muscle models of the leg plantar and dorsiflexors; and iv) an inverted pendulum model for the body biomechanics during upright stance. The motor neuron pools are driven by stochastic spike trains. Simulation results showed that the neuromechanical outputs generated by the NMS model resemble experimental data from subjects standing on a stable surface. Interesting findings were that: i) an intermittent pattern of muscle activation emerged from this posture control model for two of the leg muscles (Medial and Lateral Gastrocnemius); and ii) the Soleus muscle was mostly activated in a continuous manner. These results suggest that the spinal cord anatomy and neurophysiology (e.g., motor unit types, synaptic connectivities, ordered recruitment), along with the modulation of afferent activity, may account for the mixture of intermittent and continuous control that has been a subject of debate in recent studies on postural control. Another finding was the occurrence of the so-called “paradoxical” behaviour of muscle fibre lengths as a function of postural sway. The simulations confirmed previous conjectures that reciprocal inhibition is possibly contributing to this effect, but on the other hand showed that this effect may arise without any anticipatory neural control mechanism., The control of upright stance is a challenging task since the objective is to maintain the equilibrium of an intrinsically unstable biomechanical system. Somatosensory information is used by the central nervous system to modulate muscle contraction, which prevents the body from falling. While the visual and vestibular systems also provide important additional sensory information, a human being with only somatosensory inputs is able to maintain an upright stance. In this study, we used a biologically-based large-scale neuromusculoskeletal model driven only by somatosensory feedback to investigate human postural control from a neurophysiological point of view. No neural structures above the spinal cord were included in the model. The results showed that the model based on a spinal control of posture can reproduce several neuromechanical outcomes previously reported in the literature, including an intermittent muscle activation. Since this intermittent muscular recruitment is an emergent property of this spinal-like controller, we argue that the so-called intermittent control of upright stance might be produced by an interplay between spinal cord properties and modulated sensory inflow.},

The degree of recurrent inhibition of tonically firing alpha- and gamma-motoneurones to triceps surae muscles was assessed in decerebrated cats by measuring the change in probability of firing caused by an antidromic volley in other motoneurone axons. 2. In nine cats 91\% (thirty-one out of thirty-three) of alpha- and 54\% (twenty-five out of forty-six) of gamma-motoneurones could be inhibited by antidromic volleys in alpha-motoneurone axons. 3. The degree of recurrent inhibition, expressed as the average reduction in probability of firing during the response, was typically in the range of 59-95\% for alpha-motoneurones compared to 20-85\% for gamma-motoneurones. 4. The duration of recurrent inhibition was 20-50 msec for alpha-motoneurones and 5-40 msec for gamma-motoneurones. The duration was dependent upon the frequency of firing of a neurone, being shorter at high frequencies than at low frequencies. When alpha- and gamma-motoneurones had similar frequencies of discharge the durations of their recurrent inhibition were comparable. 5. Raising the strength of electrical stimulation to elicit an antidromic volley in gamma- as well as alpha-motoneurone axons never produced or increased recurrent inhibition in either type of motoneurone. 6. The quantitative differences in recurrent inhibition of alpha- and gamma-motoneurones are discussed in relation to the control of firing frequency.},

	isbn = {978-0-7360-6679-2},
	abstract = {Drawing on the disciplines of neurophysiology and physics, Neuromechanics of Human Movement, Fourth Edition, explores how the nervous system controls the actions of muscles to produce human motion in relation to biomechanical principles. This contemporary approach is much different from the traditional approach, which focuses solely on mechanics and does not consider the role of the sensory system in the control of human movement. Neuromechanics of Human Movement, Fourth Edition, provides a scientific foundation to the study of human movement, and as such it uses precise terms and definitions when discussing ideas and utilizing the international metric system (SI). Readers will find an appendix that helps in identifying the SI metric units as well as other learning tools, including a glossary of terms and two other appendixes that cover conversion factors and equations. Throughout the text, the content is visually reinforced with more than 750 illustrations, many of which are new or upgraded from the previous edition and include specific illustrations of the neuromechanics involved in sport and rehabilitation movements. Finally, the text contains more than 1,500 updated references and suggested reading lists for each chapter.To further enhance this fourth edition, significant content updates have been made to ensure the latest information is presented for both research and clinical environments:-New coverage regarding electromyography (EMG) that demonstrates the connection between the nervous system and the muscle by measuring the activation signal, allowing readers to better understand how motion is activated-Additional examples that underscore recent research developments in reaching and grasping activities for rehabilitation -In-depth coverage of the motor system that addresses excitable membranes, muscle and motor units, and voluntary movement-Expanded discussion of neuromuscular system adaptations to the aging process -Neuromuscular system adaptations with particular application to rehabilitation To encourage a comprehensive learning experience, this updated edition follows a logical progression where each part builds on the material from the previous section. It begins with an introduction to the biomechanical terms and concepts commonly used to describe movement, focusing on the relation between force and motion. Once readers have grasped the basic laws of motion, the text continues by considering the essential neurophysiological concepts that help to explain movement produced by the nervous system and muscle. The author uses a “bottom-up” approach for this explanation that begins with the principles of electricity and extends up to connections within the cerebral cortex. This approach encompasses the essentials of electricity responsible for the excitability of cell membranes and explains the relations between spinal neurons and muscle fibers. The third and final part of the text concludes by describing the ways in which the motor system adapts to various types of physical stress. These adapative capabilities include altering core temperature, phenomena such as strength and power training, adaptations that occur after periods of reduced activity, motor recovery from injury; and changes that occur with aging. Readers will understand how acute adjustments can be made to the motor system through interventions such as warm-up, flexibility, muscle soreness, and muscle fatigue. The fourth edition of Neuromechanics of Human Movement provides a scientific basis for the study of human movement while continuing to expand current knowledge in the fields of biomechanics and neurophysiology. By integrating these fields in a unique framework, this text offers professionals and students both valuable clinical information and inspiration to deepen their study of human movement.},

	abstract = {1. Intracellular staining of Renshaw cells and alpha motoneurons was used to determine the spatial distribution of recurrent inhibitory synapses on spinal motoneurons in the cat. In each experiment, a Renshaw cell and one or more possible target motoneurons were labeled with horseradish peroxidase after physiological identification. 2. Paris of labeled neurons were reconstructed and measured at the light microscopic level. As defined by light microscopy, presumed synaptic contacts between nine Renshaw cells and 10 postsynaptic motoneurons were observed. On average, each Renshaw cell made three synaptic contacts (range 1-9) on each motoneuron. 3. Electron microscopic confirmation of several presumed contacts provided evidence that the appositions identified by light microscopic criteria are genuine contacts between Renshaw cell boutons and the labeled motoneuron. 4. All of the identified synapses observed in these experiments were located on motoneuron dendrites, between 65 and 706 microns from the soma. Use of a simplified cable model indicated that the synapses are electrotonically close to the soma, the average location being approximately 0.25 length constants from the soma (range 0.04-0.82 lambda). 5. These observations provide direct evidence to support the hypothesis that Renshaw cell synapses on motoneurons are located on the dendrites and not on the cell body (whereas reciprocal inhibitory synapses, from Ia inhibitory interneurons, are predominantly located on the soma). The functional significance of the observed distribution of Renshaw inhibitory synapses is discussed. One possibility is that the recurrent inhibitory pathway selectively inhibits particular dendritic inputs.},

	abstract = {1. Signal averaging was used in forty experiments on low-spinal cats to measure and characterize the oligosynaptic responses of seventy-six motoneurons supplying the medial gastrocnemius muscle to the single impulses of antidromically stimulated single motor axons supplying the same muscle. 2. In thirteen experiments on chloralose-urethane anaesthetized preparations, twelve (43\%) of the tested twenty-eight motoneurones exhibited a single-axon recurrent inhibitory post-synaptic potential (recurrent i.p.s.p.), as compared to sixty-four (62\%) of the 103 motoneurones tested in twenty-seven animals in the absence of anaesthetic after ischaemic decapitation. 3. Single-axon recurrent i.p.s.p.s most often consisted of a single, long-lasting hyperpolarization. Ten of the recurrent i.p.s.p.s contained a second late peak of hyperpolarization. In another eight of the i.p.s.p.s, a small late depolarization was evident. 4. The distinct profiles of the recurrent i.p.s.p.s were readily distinguished from the relatively flat profiles with low noise levels in the averages of the fifty-five 'no-response' cells. The transmembrane and post-synaptic nature of the i.p.s.p.s was confirmed by extracellular control recordings taken immediately outside seven of the cells with positive responses. In addition, ten cells with positive responses were subjected to current passage during the averaging procedure. In all cases, depolarization increased and hyperpolarization reduced the amplitude of their single-axon recurrent i.p.s.p.s. 5. The mean amplitude of the responses was 12.0 microV in chloralose-urethane preparations as compared to a peak-to-peak noise level less than 6.0 microV in the no-response averages. Corresponding values in ischaemic-decapitate preparations were 46.2 microV and less than 7.5 microV, respectively. 6. Latency, rise-time and half-width (i.e. duration at half-amplitude) values of the i.p.s.p.s were similar for chloralose-urethane and ischaemic-decapitate preparations. The average values in both preparations were 2.5, 5.6 and 19.3 ms, respectively. The latency values indicated both disynaptic and, perhaps, longer components in the recurrent i.p.s.p.s. The rise-time and half-width values were relatively similar to those reported or measured from published records for analogous composite recurrent i.p.s.p.s (i.e. responses to antidromic stimulation of the whole muscle nerve rather than single motor axons). A weak, but significant, correlation between rise-time and half-width was observed for the sixty-six single-axon recurrent i.p.s.p.s with a single negative-going peak.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Our understanding of motor unit physiology has been derived from experimental work on the properties of single motor units and from computational studies that have integrated the experimental observations into the function of motor unit populations. The article provides brief descriptions of motor unit anatomy and muscle unit properties, with more substantial reviews of motoneuron properties, motor unit recruitment and rate modulation when humans perform voluntary contractions, and the function of an entire motor unit pool. The article emphasizes the advances in knowledge on the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the neuromodulation of motoneuron activity and attempts to explain the discharge characteristics of human motor units in terms of these principles. A major finding from this work has been the critical role of descending pathways from the brainstem in modulating the properties and activity of spinal motoneurons.

	abstract = {Activity patterns were recorded from 51 motoneurons in the fifth lumbar ventral root of cats walking on a motorized treadmill at a range of speeds between 0.1 and 1.3 m/s. The muscle of destination of recorded motoneurons was identified by spike-triggered averaging of EMG recordings from each of the anterior thigh muscles. Forty-three motoneurons projected to one of the quadriceps (vastus medialis, vastus lateralis, vastus intermedius, or rectus femoris) or sartorius (anterior or medial) muscles of the anterior thigh. Anterior thigh motoneurons always discharged a single burst of action potentials per step cycle, even in multifunctional muscles (e.g., sartorius anterior) that exhibited more than one burst of EMG activity per step cycle. The instantaneous firing rates of most motoneurons were lowest upon recruitment and increased progressively during a burst, as long as the EMG was still increasing. Firing rates peaked midway through each burst and tended to decline toward the end of the burst. The initial, mean, and peak firing rates of single motoneurons typically increased for faster walking speeds. At any given walking speed, early recruited motoneurons typically reached higher firing rates than late recruited motoneurons. In contrast to decerebrated cats, initial doublets at the beginning of bursts were seen only rarely. In the 4/51 motoneurons that showed initial doublets, both the instantaneous frequency of the doublet and the probability of starting a burst with a doublet decreased for faster walking speeds. The modulations in firing rate of every motoneuron were found to be closely correlated to the smoothed electromyogram of its target muscle. For 32 identified motoneurons, the unit's instantaneous frequencygram was scaled linearly by computer to the rectified smoothed EMG recorded from each of the anterior thigh muscles. The covariance between unitary frequencygram and muscle EMG was computed for each muscle. Typically, the EMG profile of the target muscle accounted for 0.88-0.96 of the variance in unitary firing rate. The EMG profiles of the other anterior thigh muscles, when tested in the same way, usually accounted only for a significantly smaller fraction of the variance. Brief amplitude fluctuations observed in the EMG envelopes were usually also reflected in the individual motoneuron frequencygrams. To further demonstrate the relationship between unitary frequencygrams and EMG, EMG envelopes recorded during walking were used as templates to generate depolarizing currents that were applied intracellularly to lumbar motoneurons in an acute spinal preparation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

	abstract = {Objective . Muscle force is generated by a combination of motor unit (MU) recruitment and changes in the discharge rate of active MUs. There have been two basic MU recruitment and firing rate paradigms reported in the literature, which describe the control of the MUs during force generation. The first (termed the reverse ‘onion skin’ profile), exhibits lower firing rates for lower threshold units, with higher firing rates occurring in higher threshold units. The second (termed the ‘onion skin’ profile), exhibits an inverse arrangement, with lower threshold units reaching higher firing rates. Approach . Using a simulation of the MU activity in a hand muscle, this study examined the force generation capacity and the variability of the muscle force magnitude at different excitation levels of the MU pool under these two different MU control paradigms. We sought to determine which rate/recruitment scheme was more efficient for force generation, and which scheme gave rise to the lowest force variability. Main results . We found that the force output of both firing patterns leads to graded force output at low excitation levels, and that the force generation capacity of the two different paradigms diverged around 50\% excitation. In the reverse ‘onion skin’ pattern, at 100\% excitation, the force output reached up to 88\% of maximum force, whereas for the ‘onion skin’ pattern, the force output only reached up to 54\% of maximum force at 100\% excitation. The force variability was lower at the low to moderate force levels under the ‘onion skin’ paradigm than with the reverse ‘onion skin’ firing patterns, but this effect was reversed at high force levels. Significance . This study captures the influence of MU recruitment and firing rate organization on muscle force properties, and our results suggest that the different firing organizations can be beneficial at different levels of voluntary muscle force generation and perhaps for different tasks.},

Some IPSPs from group II muscle afferents and low threshold cutaneous afferents were also slightly depressed, while other PSPs were unaffected., 3. The depression of the IPSPs could be evoked by antidromic volleys, which produced neither conductance changes in the motoneurones nor depolarization of Ia afferent terminals., 4. The effect on the Ia IPSPs is most likely due to post-synaptic inhibition of the Ia inhibitory interneurones, evoked through α-motor axon collaterals and Renshaw cells. The depression of some IPSPs from flexor reflex afferents is explained by a convergence of excitatory effects from these afferents on the Ia inhibitory interneurones., 5. The results indicate a selective recurrent control from motor axon collaterals of the interneurones in the reciprocal Ia inhibitory pathway to motoneurones.},

In all motor nuclei investigated the strongest depression of Ia IPSPs is evoked from motor fibres to muscles whose Ia afferents produce the IPSPs. For example, the Ia IPSP from the knee extensor recorded in motoneurones to a knee flexor is most effectively depressed by antidromic stimulation of motor fibres to the knee extensor., 3. The origin of recurrent inhibition of α-motoneurones and of Ia inhibitory interneurones with the same Ia input display a striking similarity. This suggests that the same population of Renshaw cells mediates effects to motoneurones and to Ia inhibitory interneurones., 4. The functional significance of impulses in motor axon collaterals was discussed and it was suggested that they have an important role in the control of the excitatory as well as inhibitory Ia actions to motoneurones.

	abstract = {1. The recurrent inhibition, brought about by a conditioning H-reflex discharge, was estimated in human subjects by the amplitude of a test H-reflex involving only the soleus motoneurones which fired in response to the conditioning volley. The modifications of the recurrent inhibition during contraction were evaluated by comparing the amplitude of the test H-reflex to a reference H-reflex. Both reflexes experienced the excitation underlying the voluntary contraction, but only the test H-reflex was subjected to the recurrent inhibition evoked by the conditioning H-reflex discharge. 2. Distinct differences were observed between the modifications of the test reflex and those of the reference H-reflex during both tonic and phasic voluntary contractions. Evidence is presented that these differences were due to changes in the amount of recurrent inhibition elicited by the conditioning discharge. 3. The changes in recurrent inhibition were studied while the subjects performed voluntary tonic contractions of various forces. The weakest contractions were accompanied by a decrease in the size of the test reflex. With greater contraction forces, there was no longer an inhibition of the test reflex, but instead a facilitation which grew continuously with increased contraction forces. The test reflex could eventually exceed the reference H-reflex amplitude at the strongest contractions. This is taken to indicate that the recurrent inhibition following the conditioning discharge was progressively decreasing, as the contraction force increased. 4. During ramp contractions, whatever the contraction velocity, the time courses of the variations of the test and reference H reflexes were almost inverse. Evidence is presented that these differential time courses were due to changes in the amount of recurrent inhibition elicited by the conditioning discharge. 5. The possibility of occlusion in the recurrent pathway ;as considered and it was concluded that the decrease in the recurrent inhibition elicited by the conditioning discharge was essentially due to an inhibitory control (spinal and/or suprasegmental) acting on Renshaw cells. This inhibition of Renshaw cells eventually counteracts the increasing excitatory inputs (resulting from the voluntary motor discharge) which they receive via motor axon collaterals during increasing tonic contractions and throughout ramp contractions. 6. The functional significance of the Renshaw cell inhibition during voluntary contraction is discussed in relation to the inhibition exerted through the recurrent pathway on both motoneurones and Ia inhibitory interneurones. It is suggested that the depression of Renshaw cell activity could play an important role during voluntary movements by favouring reciprocal Ia inhibition.},

	abstract = {1. The output from Renshaw cells caused by a phasic motor volley was investigated when these neurones were submitted to a background firing secondary to a tonic motor discharge elicited by a repetitive stimulation of muscle group I afferents. It was invariably found in individual Renshaw cells that tonic excitation produced an increase in the additional ouput caused by the phasic motor volley. The curves displaying this increase exhibited a significant 'jump' when the output resulting from the combined tonic and phasic motor discharges ranged between 2 and 5 spikes during the first 10 msec following the phasic volley. 2. The whole pool of Renshaw cells was also considered by assessing the amount of recurrent inhibition in motoneurones following a phasic motor volley. Similarly it was found that additional recurrent inhibition elicited by a phasic motor volley was enhanced when the Renshaw cells received a tonic excitatory input. 3. The Renshaw cell discharges elicited by stimulation of two different nerves were compared when a conditioning stimulus was previously applied to only one of them. The results strongly suggest that a preceding volley caused a decrease in synaptic efficacy at the terminals of the recurrent collaterals. 4. The firing produced by current injected through the recording micro-electrode was investigated in one intracellularly recorded Renshaw cell. It was found that the current-frequency curve was linear for 'steady-state' firing but displayed a clearcut sigmoid shape for the earliest intervals before the final adaptation. 5. It is demonstrated that this sigmoid input-output relation in individual Renshaw cells is sufficient to explain how the controls acting on these neurones may change the gain in the recurrent pathway when Renshaw cells are fired by a phasic motor discharge. When Renshaw cells are fired by a longlasting tonic motor discharge the linear input-output relation in individual cells should not cause any modifications of the gain in the recurrent pathway. A change in this gain secondary to the effects of segmental and supraspinal control systems is, however, possible if the motor discharge creates a subliminal fringe within the pool of Renshaw cells.},

However, a linear relation between the reflex size and the early discharge emerged when the responses of all the Renshaw cells were averaged or when the summed activity of a pool of Renshaw cells was estimated by recording the recurrent inhibition in their target motoneurones. It was concluded that the lowest threshold motoneurones were efficient in producing recurrent inhibition. 2. In motoneurones, recorded intracellularly, the size of the depression caused by the afterhyperpolarization was compared to the maximum autogenetic recurrent inhibition. Under the particular experimental conditions used to mimic human experiments (Hultborn \& Pierrot-Deseilligny, 1979a), it was found that recurrent inhibition had the same order of magnitude as the depression caused by afterhyperpolarization. 3. The additional depression caused by the summation of afterhyperpolarizations of two consecutive spikes was measured. It was shown that a summation of importance equal to the maximum autogenic recurrent inhibition required a mean interspike interval of 25 msec.},

First, the size of the MSR recorded in ventral roots is not linearly related to the number of recruited motor units, since larger motor axons contribute more to the size of the MSR than smaller ones. Second, the number of spikes evoked in a Renshaw cell burst is not linearly related to the excitatory input because Renshaw cell discharge saturates in the case of large responses. The contribution of small, early-recruited motoneurones to Renshaw cell excitation is consequently overestimated. Procedures were introduced to deal with these problems. It is concluded that the last-recruited motor units (probably 'fast twitch, fast fatiguing') on average contribute four times as much excitation to Renshaw cells as the first recruited ('slow twitch') motor units.},

Maximal homonymous recurrent IPSP (RIPSP) and input resistance (RN) were measured at 'resting' membrane potential and close to firing threshold. The 'synaptic current' at the peak of the RIPSP was estimated (RIPSP/RN). At 'resting' membrane potential the RIPSPs increased in the order FF less than FR less than S (0.9, 1.4, and 2.5 mV, respectively). This order was preserved when the 'current' (RIPSP/RN) rather than voltage was considered, although the overall range was much reduced. When investigated close to firing threshold there were no significant differences in synaptic 'current'. This apparent paradox may be explained by systematic differences in firing threshold between motor unit types; it increased in the order S less than FR less than FF (4.6, 8.9 and 13.5 mV, respectively).},

	abstract = {This book presents a summary of knowledge concerning somatic motoneurones, the cells which link the central nervous system to the skeletal muscles. There are two functional kinds of such motoneurones: the alpha motoneurones innervating skeletal muscle fibres and the smaller gamma motoneurones which exclusively innervate muscle fibres of complex intramuscular sense organs, the muscle spindles. This book deals primarily with the alpha motoneurones, which together constitute the main output interface of the central nervous system and without which no muscle action is possible. The study of motoneurones is important for general insights as to how neurones work, because the alpha motoneurone is probably the best understood kind of nerve cell so far in neuroscience. Motoneurones of the spinal cord were the first type of central nerve cell to be subjected to detailed physiological measurements, and much is known about how their activity is regulated by synapses from other neurones. For most of the individual neurones within the central nervous system, the precise functional tasks are difficult to define. However, for alpha motoneurones much is known about their short- and long-term interactions with their main targets, the skeletal muscle fibres. Functions of neurones must be analyzed in relation to the response properties of their target cells. Therefore, this book deals with both, summarizing classical as well as recent knowledge concerning motoneurones and their muscle fibres (i.e., motor units).},

	abstract = {1. Steady-state recurrent (Renshaw) inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (RIPSPs) were evoked in cat triceps surae motoneurons by stimulating the heteronymous muscle nerve at 100 Hz after dorsal root section. The effective synaptic currents (i.e., the net synaptic current measured at the soma, IN) underlying these inhibitory potentials were measured with a modified voltage-clamp technique. 2. The average value of the effective synaptic currents measured in medial gastrocnemius (MG) motoneurons was 0.4 nA. There was no significant correlation between the IN measured in individual cells and motoneuron input resistance (RN), rheobase (IR), duration of the spike afterhyperpolarization (AHPt1/2), or putative motor-unit type, although the steady-state inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP) amplitudes were correlated with all of these parameters. 3. Steady-state recurrent inhibition was accompanied by a small (3.5\%, on average) decrease in the resting input resistance of the motoneurons. The small magnitude of this measured change supports the hypothesis of Burke et al. that the site of synaptic contact between Renshaw cells and motoneurons is somewhat distal to the cell soma. 4. The absence of a differential distribution of the effective synaptic currents generated by Renshaw cells within the MG pool does not support the idea that recurrent inhibition mediates a selective reduction of the firing of small, low-threshold motoneurons by large, high-threshold motoneurons. The small amplitude of the effective synaptic currents we measured suggests that the contribution of recurrent inhibition to the direct modulation of motoneuron firing rate is subtle and that it is perhaps principally involved in the fine control and smooth production of muscle force.},

Motoneuron impedance was determined by injecting quasi-white noise current into lumbosacral motoneurons of pentobarbital-anesthetized cats. Synaptic location and conductance were estimated by comparing observed impedance changes to simulation results obtained using standard motoneuron models and compartmental models fit to each impedance function. Estimated synaptic locations ranged from 0.10 to 0.41λ, with a mean of 0.19 or 0.24λ, depending on the estimation method. Average dendritic path length was 262 μm. Average synaptic conductance was 23 to 27 nS (range: 6.7 to 57.9 nS), corresponding to conductance changes of 78 to 88\% of resting membrane conductance. Estimated accuracy was supported by consistency using different estimation methods, agreement with Fyffe's 1991 morphological data, and comparisons of observed and simulated recurrent IPSP amplitudes. Synaptic location, but not synaptic conductance, was correlated with rheobase, a measure of motoneuron excitability. Synaptic conductance did not depend on synaptic location. A regression analysis demonstrated that synaptic conductance and cell impedance were the principal factors determining recurrent IPSP amplitude. Simulations using the observed values and locations of Renshaw conductance demonstrate that recurrent inhibition can require as much as an additional 14 to 18\% sustained excitatory synaptic conductance to depolarize motoneurons sufficiently to activate somatic or dendritic inward currents and recruit motoneurons or amplify excitatory synaptic currents.},

	abstract = {1. The amplitude of recurrent inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (RIPSPs) was examined in pairs of lumbosacral motoneurons that were separated by a known distance and were identified by antidromic stimulation of muscle nerves. One motoneuron was stimulated by injecting depolarizing current pulses, and postsynaptic responses were recorded and averaged in the second motoneuron. Input resistance, rheobase, and conduction velocity were determined for many motoneurons. Most motoneurons innervated extensor muscles. 2. RIPSP values as large as -283 microV were recorded, but most were between -10 and -40 microV. RIPSPs from individual motoneurons of a pool are distributed to several heteronymous motor nuclei and have a range of amplitudes comparable with homonymous RIPSPs. 3. A specific spatial distribution of RIPSP amplitudes was found whereby the largest RIPSP amplitudes ({\textgreater} 40 microV) occurred in motoneurons located within +/- 1.4 mm of the stimulated motoneuron. A significant correlation was found between RIPSP amplitude and the distance between motoneurons for all motoneuron pairs. This correlation was also found within individual groups of motoneuron pairs that innervate the lateral gastrocnemius, medial gastrocnemius, anterior-middle biceps femoris, or soleus muscles. 4. The dependency of RIPSP amplitude on the motoneuron species, which is the particular muscle a motoneuron innervates, is less distinct than the dependency of RIPSP amplitude on topography. Pooling all motoneuron species of close motoneuron pairs indicated that RIPSPs measured in homonymous motoneuron pairs were greater in amplitude than RIPSPs measured in heteronymous pairs. In addition, homonymous RIPSPs of anterior middle biceps femoris or lateral gastrocnemius motoneurons were greater than heteronymous RIPSPs of those motoneurons in all heteronymous combinations. However, homonymous and heteronymous RIPSPs were not significantly different when heteronymous pairs were restricted to individual combinations of species. These findings indicate that RIPSP amplitudes within a set of motor nuclei interconnected by recurrent inhibition are dependent in some cases on the species of motoneurons, but this effect is less important than the effect of topography on RIPSP amplitude. 5. These results indicate that recurrent inhibition in motoneuron pools that innervate hindlimb extensor muscles has a strong topographic organization, such that the strongest recurrent inhibition is produced by each motoneuron in a restricted rostrocaudal zone that includes both homonymous and heteronymous motor nuclei. This suggests that recurrent inhibition is organized for the control of several motor nuclei engaged in common motor activity as well as regulation of activity within individual motor pools.},

	abstract = {Unlike upper limb muscles, it remains undocumented as to how motor units in the soleus muscle are organised in terms of recruitment range and discharge rates with respect to their recruitment and de-recruitment thresholds. The possible influence of neuromodulation, such as persistent inward currents (PICs) on lower limb motor unit recruitment and discharge rates has also yet to be reported. To address these issues, electromyographic (EMG) activities from the soleus muscle were recorded using selective branched-wire intramuscular electrodes during ramp-and-hold contractions with intensities up to maximal voluntary contraction (MVC). The multiple single motor unit activities were then derived using a decomposition technique. The onset–offset hysteresis of motor unit discharge, i.e. a difference between recruitment and de-recruitment thresholds, as well as PIC magnitude calculated by a paired motor unit analysis were used to examine the neuromodulatory effects on discharge behaviours, such as minimum firing rate, peak firing rate and degree of increase in firing rate. Forty-two clearly identified motor units from five subjects revealed that soleus motor units are recruited progressively from rest to contraction strengths close to 95\% of MVC, with low-threshold motor units discharging action potentials slower at their recruitment and with a lower peak rate than later recruited high-threshold units. This observation is in contrast to the ‘onion skin phenomenon’ often reported for the upper limb muscles. Based on positive correlations of the peak discharge rates, initial rates and recruitment order of the units with the magnitude of the onset–offset hysteresis and not PIC contribution, we conclude that discharge behaviours among motor units appear to be related to a variation in an intrinsic property other than PICs.},

	doi = {10.1007/BF00585405},
	abstract = {1. The contraction of limb extensor muscles during side-down roll tilt of the animal depends upon an increased discharge of excitatory vestibulospinal (VS) neurons (α-response) and a reduced discharge of inhibitory reticulospinal (RS) neurons of the medulla (β-response), both acting on ipsilateral limb extensor motoneurons. In the decerebrate cat, a modulation of the multiunit EMG activity was clearly present in forelimb extensors, but was extremely weak or absent in hindlimb extensors. 2. Experiments performed in decerebrate cats with the deefferented GS muscle fixed at a constant length have shown that Renshaw (R)-cells, monosynaptically coupled with gastrocnemius-soleus (GS) motoneurons, were either unresponsive or displayed only very weak, small amplitude α-responses to sinusoidal stimulation of labyrinth receptors elicited during slow head rotation after bilateral neck deafferentation. This effect was attributed to excitatory VS volleys acting on GS motoneurons and, through their recurrent collaterals, on the related R-cells. In these instances the recurrent inhibition of the GS motoneurons contributed to the very low gain of the EMG response of the corresponding muscles to labyrinth stimulation. 3. Intravenous injection of an anticholinesterase (eserine sulphate, 0.05–0.1 mg/kg) at a dose that in previous experiments increased the firing rate of medullary RS neurons, while decreasing the decerebrate rigidity, slightly increased the discharge rate of R-cells linked with the GS motoneurons in the animal at rest; these findings suggest that the RS system inhibits the extensor motoneurons by exciting the related R-cells. All the R-cells, which prior to the injection were either unresponsive or showed an α-response to head rotation (at 0.026–0.15 Hz, ±10°), after eserine sulphate showed a β-response for the same parameters of labyrinth stimulation. In particular, a reduced discharge of the R-cells linked with the GS motoneurons occurred during side-down head rotation as shown for the majority of the RS neurons. It appears therefore that the same R-cells, which in the normal decerebrate cat responded to the excitatory VS volleys acting through the GS motoneurons, were now decoupled from their input motoneurons during head rotation, thus behaving as if they underwent the most efficient direct excitatory control of the RS system. The reduced discharge of the R-cells linked with the GS motoneurons during side-down head rotation would lead to disinhibition of these motoneurons, thus enhancing the response gain of the corresponding muscle to labyrinth stimulation. 4. This hypothesis was supported by the results of electromyographic experiments showing that the modulation of the multiunit activity of the GS muscle, which in normal decerebrate cats was negligible or extremely poor in amplitude, greatly increased after injection of the same dose of anticholinesterase. 5. We postulate that the inhibitory RS system, which is under the tonic excitatory control of a cholinergic system, operates through the R-cells as a variable gain regulator, acting at the motoneuronal level during the vestibular reflexes. The results of the present experiments support the general hypothesis on the function recently attributed to the recurrent inhibitory circuit in the spinal cord.},

Starting with a simple model of the neuron as an electrical circuit, gradually more details are added to include the effects of neuronal morphology, synapses, ion channels and intracellular signaling. The principle of abstraction is explained through chapters on simplifying models, and how simplified models can be used in networks.

	abstract = {.Recurrent inhibition in the mammalian spinal cord is complex, and its functions are not yet well understood. Skeletomotoneurons (α-MNs) excite, via recurrent axon collaterals, inhibitory Renshaw cells (RCs), which in turn inhibit α-MNs and other neurons. The anatomical and functional structure of the recurrent inhibitory network is nonhomogeneous, and the gain and filtering characteristics of RCs are modulated by inputs circumventing α-MNs. This complex organization is likely to play important roles for the discharge and recruitment properties of α-MNs. Modeling this system is a way of investigating hypothesized roles for normal functioning including muscle fatigue and different forms of physiological pathological tremor. In this paper, a detailed model including α-MNs, RCs, and the muscle fibers innervated by the α-MNs is presented. Outlines of the experimental data underlying the model and the modeling philosophy and procedure are presented. Then the behavior of a RC model is compared with experimental data reported in the literature. Model and experimental data agree well for burst responses elicited by synchronous single-pulse activation of different numbers of motor axons. In addition, the static relation between motor-axon activation rate and RC firing rate agree fairly well in model and experiment, and the same applies to the dynamic responses to step changes in motor-axon rate. The ultimate objective is to use this model in probing the role of recurrent inhibition in the control and stability of (isometric) muscular force under normal and altered conditions occurring during fatigue and muscle pain.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate, by computer simulation, the role of recurrent inhibition in shaping the input-output (I/O) relationships between descending command signals (DCS) as inputs and motoneuron (MN) and Renshaw cell (RC) firing rates and muscle force as outputs. Changing the spatial (topographical) distribution of recurrent inhibition from nonhomogeneous (as in the standard model) to homogeneous did not alter the I/O relationships significantly, while changing the functional distribution related to MN types did. Altering the global gain of recurrent inhibition, as happens naturally in various motor acts, changes the slopes and positions (at high inputs) of the I/O relationships, making recurrent inhibition a suitable means of gain control. Coupling a decrease in recurrent inhibitory gain with an increase in DCS input, as could occur during slow dynamic contractions, would increase the MN and force gains during the act. Short dynamic ramp-and-hold DCS inputs generate MN firing patterns, to which recurrent inhibition contributes interspike-interval variability and damped oscillations, which are related to issues of tremor and its control.},

In a total of 5 cases, the two cells of such a pair showed mutual synaptic interactions: single motoneurone spikes excited the Renshaw cell, and Renshaw cell spikes caused the appearance of short-latency hyperpolarizing potential changes in the motoneurone. Unidirectional interactions were also seen: in two cases motoneurones excited Renshaw cells from which they received no inhibition, and in 7 cases Renshaw cells caused hyperpolarizing potential changes in motoneurones from which they received no excitation. The inhibitory effect of a single Renshaw cell onto a motoneurone was very weak (average 12.7 μV; range 1.5–54 μV hyperpolarization; n = 12).},

	abstract = {This study investigates the motor unit recruitment patterns between and within muscles of the triceps surae during cycling on a stationary ergometer at a range of pedal speeds and resistances. Muscle activity was measured from the soleus (SOL), medial gastrocnemius (MG) and lateral gastrocnemius (LG) using surface electromyography (EMG) and quantified using wavelet and principal component analysis. Muscle fascicle strain rates were quantified using ultrasonography, and the muscle–tendon unit lengths were calculated from the segmental kinematics. The EMG intensities showed that the body uses the SOL relatively more for the higher-force, lower-velocity contractions than the MG and LG. The EMG spectra showed a shift to higher frequencies at faster muscle fascicle strain rates for MG: these shifts were independent of the level of muscle activity, the locomotor load and the muscle fascicle strain. These results indicated that a selective recruitment of the faster motor units occurred within the MG muscle in response to the increasing muscle fascicle strain rates. This preferential recruitment of the faster fibres for the faster tasks indicates that in some circumstances motor unit recruitment during locomotion can match the contractile properties of the muscle fibres to the mechanical demands of the contraction.},

However, after bursts of impulses an afterhyperpolarization could be detected which probably contributes to a pause in firing after the initial response.

	abstract = {This study focuses on neuromuscular mechanisms behind ankle torque and EMG variability during a maintained isometric plantar flexion contraction. Experimentally obtained torque standard deviation (SD) and soleus, medial gastrocnemius, and lateral gastrocnemius EMG envelope mean and SD increased with mean torque for a wide range of torque levels. Computer simulations were performed on a biophysically-based neuromuscular model of the triceps surae consisting of premotoneuronal spike trains (the global input, GI) driving the motoneuron pools of the soleus, medial gastrocnemius, and lateral gastrocnemius muscles, which activate their respective muscle units. Two types of point processes were adopted to represent the statistics of the GI: Poisson and Gamma. Simulations showed a better agreement with experimental results when the GI was modeled by Gamma point processes having lower orders (higher variability) for higher target torques. At the same time, the simulations reproduced well the experimental data of EMG envelope mean and SD as a function of mean plantar flexion torque, for the three muscles. These results suggest that the experimentally found relations between torque-EMG variability as a function of mean plantar flexion torque level depend not only on the intrinsic properties of the motoneuron pools and the muscle units innervated, but also on the increasing variability of the premotoneuronal GI spike trains when their mean rates increase to command a higher plantar flexion torque level. The simulations also provided information on spike train statistics of several hundred motoneurons that compose the triceps surae, providing a wide picture of the associated mechanisms behind torque and EMG variability.},

Large-scale computational models of a motoneuron pool and the muscle it innervates have been used as tools to advance the knowledge of how neural elements may influence force control. Here, we present a frequency domain analysis of a NARX model fitted to a large-scale neuromuscular model by the means of generalized frequency response functions (GFRF). The results of such procedures indicated that the computational neuromuscular model was capable of transforming an oscillatory synaptic input (e.g., at 20 Hz) into a constant mean muscle force output. The nonlinearity uncovered by the GFRFs of the NARX model was responsible for the demodulation of an oscillatory input (e.g., a beta band oscillation coming from the brain and forming the input to the motoneuron pool). This suggests a manner by which brain rhythms descending as command signals to the spinal cord and acting on a motoneuron pool can regulate a maintained muscle force. In addition to the scientific aspects of these results, they provide new interpretations that may further neural engineering applications associated with quantitative neurological diagnoses and robotic systems for artificial limbs.},

	abstract = {Membrane electrical properties [time constant, action potential afterhyperpolarization (AHP), rheobase, input resistance, and axonal conduction velocity] were measured in motoneurons of cat medial gastrocnemius (MG) motor units. Motor units were classified on the basis of their mechanical responses as fast twitch, fast fatiguing (FF); fast twitch with intermediate fatigue resistance (FI); fast twitch, fatigue resistant (FR); or slow twitch, fatigue resistant (S; 11, 22). Motoneuron membrane time constant, estimated from the voltage response at the onset or termination of long (50-100 ms) current pulses and corrected for voltage-response nonlinearities (32), was found to differ significantly among the major motor-unit types, increasing in the order FF less than FR less than S. Afterhyperpolarization magnitude, half-decay time, and duration were all significantly greater for the fast (FF + FI + FR) versus the slow (S) motor units. The AHP half-decay time was correlated with muscle unit twitch time over the entire motoneuron population and within the type S motor-unit population. There was no significant correlation between twitch time and AHP half-decay time among the types FF and FR motor-unit populations. In agreement with previous studies, we found a significant difference in both rheobase and input resistance among the major motor-unit types, with rheobase increasing in the order S less than FR less than FF and input resistance decreasing in that order (S greater than FR greater than FF). The differences in input resistance were present both before and after correcting for voltage-response nonlinearities (32). Also in agreement with previous studies, the mean axonal conduction velocity was significantly faster among the fast (FF + FI + and FR) compared with the slow (S) motor units. These data were used to examine the properties alone to determine motor-unit type, which has traditionally been defined on the basis of the muscle unit's mechanical properties (11, 22). We used a discriminant analysis program to classify 73 mechanically typed motor units for which we had measures of rheobase, input resistance, membrane time constant, and AHP half-decay time. This model was able to properly classify 71 of the 73 motor units of this data set, indicating that the motor units of this data set could be grouped into three categories representing the three major motor-unit types (FF, FR, and S) on the basis of their rheobase, input resistance, membrane time constant, and AHP half-decay time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},
