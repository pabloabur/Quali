	abstract = {Cholinergic terminals in the rat spinal cord were revealed by immunohistochemical detection of the vesicular acetycholine transporter (VAChT). In order to determine the relationships of these terminals to Renshaw cells, we used dual immunolabelling with antibodies against gephyrin or calbindin D28k to provide immunohistochemical identification of Renshaw cells in lamina VII of the ventral horn.
            
            
              A total of 50 Renshaw cells were analysed quantitatively using a computer-aided reconstruction system to provide accurate localization of contact sites and determination of somatic and dendritic surface area. Dendrites could be traced for up to 413 μm from the soma in calbindin D28k-identified Renshaw cells and up to 184 μm in gephyrin-identified cells.
            
            
              A total of 3330 cholinergic terminals were observed on 50 Renshaw cells, with a range of 21–138 terminal appositions per cell (mean 66.6 ± 25.56 contacts per cell). The vast majority (83.5\%) of the terminals were apposed to dendrites rather than the soma. The overall density of cholinergic contacts increased from a little above 1 per 100 μm2 on the soma and initial 25 μm of proximal dendrites to 4–5 per 100 μm2 on the surface of dendritic segments located 50–250 μm from the soma. Single presynaptic fibres frequently formed multiple contacts with the soma and/or dendrites of individual Renshaw cells.
            
            
              VAChT-immunoreactive terminals apposed to Renshaw cells varied in size from 0.6 to 6.9 μm in diameter (mean 2.26 ± 0.94; n= 986) and were on average smaller than the cholinergic C-terminals apposed to motoneurones, but larger than VAChT-immunoreactive terminals contacting other ventral horn interneurones.
            
            
              The high density and relatively large size of many cholinergic terminals on Renshaw cells presumably correlates with the strong synaptic connection between motoneurones and Renshaw cells. The fact that the majority of contacts are distributed over the dendrites makes the motoneurone axon collateral input susceptible to inhibition by the prominent glycinergic inhibitory synapses located on the soma and proximal dendrites. The relative positions and structural features of the excitatory cholinergic and inhibitory glycinergic synapses may explain why Renshaw cells, although capable of firing at very high frequency following motor axon stimulation, appear to fire at relatively low rates during locomotor activity.},

	abstract = {Effects on single lumbar gamma-motoneurones, mediated via fibres running in the ventral roots, were studied by micro-electrode recording in cats anaesthetized with chloralose. Graded electrical stimulation of ventral roots or of peripheral nerves was used. The cells were identified as gamma-motoneurones by antidromic stimulation and by measurement of their axonal conduction velocity. Some of the cells were classified as static or dynamic. The findings confirm the previously demonstrated existence of low-threshold, presumed recurrent, inhibition of both static and dynamic gamma-motoneurones. Strong evidence for the occurrence of high-threshold recurrent inhibition of gamma-motoneurones is also presented. In addition, excitatory effects on gamma-cells, also mediated via fibres in the ventral roots, are described. The low-threshold effects from ventral root fibres are attributed to recurrent alpha-collateral activity and the high-threshold effects to gamma-collateral activity. The significance of recurrent inhibition of gamma-motoneurones is discussed in relation to the ‘gain regulator’ concept proposed by Hultborn, Lindström \& Wigström (1979).},

We present material at the cutting edge of neuroscience in a way that is accessible to both science and nonscience students alike. The level of the material is comparable to an introductory college text in general biology. The book is divided into four parts: Part I, Foundations; Part {II}, Sensory and Motor Systems; Part {III}, The Brain and Behavior; and Part {IV}, The Changing Brain. We begin Part I by introducing the modern field of neuroscience and tracing some of its historical antecedents. Then we take a close look at the structure and function of individual neurons, how they communicate chemically, and how these building blocks are arranged to form a nervous system. In Part {II}, we go inside the brain to examine the structure and function of the systems that serve the senses and command voluntary movements. In Part {III}, we explore the neurobiology of human behavior, including motivation, sex, emotion, sleep, language, attention, and mental illness. Finally, in Part {IV}, we look at how the environment modifies the brain, both during development and in adult learning and memory"--Provided by publisher},

This dependence is well described by a rectangular hyperbola that approaches saturation with increasing stimulus frequency. The tendency to saturate is independent of the number of motor axons exciting a Renshaw cell. On average, the stimulus frequency at which the discharge rate reaches half its saturation value lies between 10 and 15 Hz. The effect of Renshaw cell activity — measured as the antidromic inhibition of individual α-motoneurons — reflects the form of the static frequency characteristics. An electric circuit analog of the Renshaw cell membrane is presented which serves to explain the qualitative features of the static input-output relations; the nonlinearity is the result of synapses with linear properties acting together at the cell membrane.},

	abstract = {Several models have been employed to study human postural control during upright quiet stance. Most have adopted an inverted pendulum approximation to the standing human and theoretical models to account for the neural feedback necessary to keep balance. The present study adds to the previous efforts in focusing more closely on modelling the physiological mechanisms of important elements associated with the control of human posture. This paper studies neuromuscular mechanisms behind upright stance control by means of a biologically based large-scale neuromusculoskeletal (NMS) model. It encompasses: i) conductance-based spinal neuron models (motor neurons and interneurons); ii) muscle proprioceptor models (spindle and Golgi tendon organ) providing sensory afferent feedback; iii) Hill-type muscle models of the leg plantar and dorsiflexors; and iv) an inverted pendulum model for the body biomechanics during upright stance. The motor neuron pools are driven by stochastic spike trains. Simulation results showed that the neuromechanical outputs generated by the NMS model resemble experimental data from subjects standing on a stable surface. Interesting findings were that: i) an intermittent pattern of muscle activation emerged from this posture control model for two of the leg muscles (Medial and Lateral Gastrocnemius); and ii) the Soleus muscle was mostly activated in a continuous manner. These results suggest that the spinal cord anatomy and neurophysiology (e.g., motor unit types, synaptic connectivities, ordered recruitment), along with the modulation of afferent activity, may account for the mixture of intermittent and continuous control that has been a subject of debate in recent studies on postural control. Another finding was the occurrence of the so-called “paradoxical” behaviour of muscle fibre lengths as a function of postural sway. The simulations confirmed previous conjectures that reciprocal inhibition is possibly contributing to this effect, but on the other hand showed that this effect may arise without any anticipatory neural control mechanism., The control of upright stance is a challenging task since the objective is to maintain the equilibrium of an intrinsically unstable biomechanical system. Somatosensory information is used by the central nervous system to modulate muscle contraction, which prevents the body from falling. While the visual and vestibular systems also provide important additional sensory information, a human being with only somatosensory inputs is able to maintain an upright stance. In this study, we used a biologically-based large-scale neuromusculoskeletal model driven only by somatosensory feedback to investigate human postural control from a neurophysiological point of view. No neural structures above the spinal cord were included in the model. The results showed that the model based on a spinal control of posture can reproduce several neuromechanical outcomes previously reported in the literature, including an intermittent muscle activation. Since this intermittent muscular recruitment is an emergent property of this spinal-like controller, we argue that the so-called intermittent control of upright stance might be produced by an interplay between spinal cord properties and modulated sensory inflow.},

In nine cats 91\% (thirty-one out of thirty-three) of alpha- and 54\% (twenty-five out of forty-six) of gamma-motoneurones could be inhibited by antidromic volleys in alpha-motoneurone axons. 3. The degree of recurrent inhibition, expressed as the average reduction in probability of firing during the response, was typically in the range of 59-95\% for alpha-motoneurones compared to 20-85\% for gamma-motoneurones. 4. The duration of recurrent inhibition was 20-50 msec for alpha-motoneurones and 5-40 msec for gamma-motoneurones. The duration was dependent upon the frequency of firing of a neurone, being shorter at high frequencies than at low frequencies. When alpha- and gamma-motoneurones had similar frequencies of discharge the durations of their recurrent inhibition were comparable. 5. Raising the strength of electrical stimulation to elicit an antidromic volley in gamma- as well as alpha-motoneurone axons never produced or increased recurrent inhibition in either type of motoneurone. 6.

	isbn = {978-0-7360-6679-2},
	abstract = {Drawing on the disciplines of neurophysiology and physics, Neuromechanics of Human Movement, Fourth Edition, explores how the nervous system controls the actions of muscles to produce human motion in relation to biomechanical principles. This contemporary approach is much different from the traditional approach, which focuses solely on mechanics and does not consider the role of the sensory system in the control of human movement. Neuromechanics of Human Movement, Fourth Edition, provides a scientific foundation to the study of human movement, and as such it uses precise terms and definitions when discussing ideas and utilizing the international metric system (SI). Readers will find an appendix that helps in identifying the SI metric units as well as other learning tools, including a glossary of terms and two other appendixes that cover conversion factors and equations. Throughout the text, the content is visually reinforced with more than 750 illustrations, many of which are new or upgraded from the previous edition and include specific illustrations of the neuromechanics involved in sport and rehabilitation movements. Finally, the text contains more than 1,500 updated references and suggested reading lists for each chapter.To further enhance this fourth edition, significant content updates have been made to ensure the latest information is presented for both research and clinical environments:-New coverage regarding electromyography (EMG) that demonstrates the connection between the nervous system and the muscle by measuring the activation signal, allowing readers to better understand how motion is activated-Additional examples that underscore recent research developments in reaching and grasping activities for rehabilitation -In-depth coverage of the motor system that addresses excitable membranes, muscle and motor units, and voluntary movement-Expanded discussion of neuromuscular system adaptations to the aging process -Neuromuscular system adaptations with particular application to rehabilitation To encourage a comprehensive learning experience, this updated edition follows a logical progression where each part builds on the material from the previous section. It begins with an introduction to the biomechanical terms and concepts commonly used to describe movement, focusing on the relation between force and motion. Once readers have grasped the basic laws of motion, the text continues by considering the essential neurophysiological concepts that help to explain movement produced by the nervous system and muscle. The author uses a “bottom-up” approach for this explanation that begins with the principles of electricity and extends up to connections within the cerebral cortex. This approach encompasses the essentials of electricity responsible for the excitability of cell membranes and explains the relations between spinal neurons and muscle fibers. The third and final part of the text concludes by describing the ways in which the motor system adapts to various types of physical stress. These adapative capabilities include altering core temperature, phenomena such as strength and power training, adaptations that occur after periods of reduced activity, motor recovery from injury; and changes that occur with aging. Readers will understand how acute adjustments can be made to the motor system through interventions such as warm-up, flexibility, muscle soreness, and muscle fatigue. The fourth edition of Neuromechanics of Human Movement provides a scientific basis for the study of human movement while continuing to expand current knowledge in the fields of biomechanics and neurophysiology. By integrating these fields in a unique framework, this text offers professionals and students both valuable clinical information and inspiration to deepen their study of human movement.},

	abstract = {1. Intracellular staining of Renshaw cells and alpha motoneurons was used to determine the spatial distribution of recurrent inhibitory synapses on spinal motoneurons in the cat. In each experiment, a Renshaw cell and one or more possible target motoneurons were labeled with horseradish peroxidase after physiological identification. 2. Paris of labeled neurons were reconstructed and measured at the light microscopic level. As defined by light microscopy, presumed synaptic contacts between nine Renshaw cells and 10 postsynaptic motoneurons were observed. On average, each Renshaw cell made three synaptic contacts (range 1-9) on each motoneuron. 3. Electron microscopic confirmation of several presumed contacts provided evidence that the appositions identified by light microscopic criteria are genuine contacts between Renshaw cell boutons and the labeled motoneuron. 4. All of the identified synapses observed in these experiments were located on motoneuron dendrites, between 65 and 706 microns from the soma. Use of a simplified cable model indicated that the synapses are electrotonically close to the soma, the average location being approximately 0.25 length constants from the soma (range 0.04-0.82 lambda). 5. These observations provide direct evidence to support the hypothesis that Renshaw cell synapses on motoneurons are located on the dendrites and not on the cell body (whereas reciprocal inhibitory synapses, from Ia inhibitory interneurons, are predominantly located on the soma). The functional significance of the observed distribution of Renshaw inhibitory synapses is discussed. One possibility is that the recurrent inhibitory pathway selectively inhibits particular dendritic inputs.},

Both the incidence and amplitude of 'close-pair' recurrent i.p.s.p.s were shown to be significantly larger than the corresponding values for 'distant-pair' recurrent i.p.s.p.s. 4.

Signal averaging was used in forty experiments on low-spinal cats to measure and characterize the oligosynaptic responses of seventy-six motoneurons supplying the medial gastrocnemius muscle to the single impulses of antidromically stimulated single motor axons supplying the same muscle. 2. In thirteen experiments on chloralose-urethane anaesthetized preparations, twelve (43\%) of the tested twenty-eight motoneurones exhibited a single-axon recurrent inhibitory post-synaptic potential (recurrent i.p.s.p.), as compared to sixty-four (62\%) of the 103 motoneurones tested in twenty-seven animals in the absence of anaesthetic after ischaemic decapitation. 3. Single-axon recurrent i.p.s.p.s most often consisted of a single, long-lasting hyperpolarization. Ten of the recurrent i.p.s.p.s contained a second late peak of hyperpolarization. In another eight of the i.p.s.p.s, a small late depolarization was evident. 4. The distinct profiles of the recurrent i.p.s.p.s were readily distinguished from the relatively flat profiles with low noise levels in the averages of the fifty-five 'no-response' cells. The transmembrane and post-synaptic nature of the i.p.s.p.s was confirmed by extracellular control recordings taken immediately outside seven of the cells with positive responses. In addition, ten cells with positive responses were subjected to current passage during the averaging procedure. In all cases, depolarization increased and hyperpolarization reduced the amplitude of their single-axon recurrent i.p.s.p.s. 5. The mean amplitude of the responses was 12.0 microV in chloralose-urethane preparations as compared to a peak-to-peak noise level less than 6.0 microV in the no-response averages. Corresponding values in ischaemic-decapitate preparations were 46.2 microV and less than 7.5 microV, respectively. 6. Latency, rise-time and half-width (i.e. duration at half-amplitude) values of the i.p.s.p.s were similar for chloralose-urethane and ischaemic-decapitate preparations. The average values in both preparations were 2.5, 5.6 and 19.3 ms, respectively. The latency values indicated both disynaptic and, perhaps, longer components in the recurrent i.p.s.p.s. The rise-time and half-width values were relatively similar to those reported or measured from published records for analogous composite recurrent i.p.s.p.s (i.e. responses to antidromic stimulation of the whole muscle nerve rather than single motor axons). A weak, but significant, correlation between rise-time and half-width was observed for the sixty-six single-axon recurrent i.p.s.p.s with a single negative-going peak.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

The effects of impulses in recurrent motor axon collaterals on reflex transmission from different types of primary afferents to motoneurones were investigated in the cat by conditioning of PSPs evoked in motoneurones., 2. IPSPs evoked by volleys in large muscle spindle (Ia) afferents were effectively decreased when preceded by an antidromic stimulation of ventral roots. Some IPSPs from group II muscle afferents and low threshold cutaneous afferents were also slightly depressed, while other PSPs were unaffected., 3. The depression of the IPSPs could be evoked by antidromic volleys, which produced neither conductance changes in the motoneurones nor depolarization of Ia afferent terminals., 4. The effect on the Ia IPSPs is most likely due to post-synaptic inhibition of the Ia inhibitory interneurones, evoked through α-motor axon collaterals and Renshaw cells. The depression of some IPSPs from flexor reflex afferents is explained by a convergence of excitatory effects from these afferents on the Ia inhibitory interneurones., 5. The results indicate a selective recurrent control from motor axon collaterals of the interneurones in the reciprocal Ia inhibitory pathway to motoneurones.},

The test IPSPs were evoked by stimulation of dorsal roots and the conditioning antidromic volleys by stimulation of motor fibres in different peripheral muscle nerves., 2. In all motor nuclei investigated the strongest depression of Ia IPSPs is evoked from motor fibres to muscles whose Ia afferents produce the IPSPs. For example, the Ia IPSP from the knee extensor recorded in motoneurones to a knee flexor is most effectively depressed by antidromic stimulation of motor fibres to the knee extensor., 3. The origin of recurrent inhibition of α-motoneurones and of Ia inhibitory interneurones with the same Ia input display a striking similarity. This suggests that the same population of Renshaw cells mediates effects to motoneurones and to Ia inhibitory interneurones., 4. The functional significance of impulses in motor axon collaterals was discussed and it was suggested that they have an important role in the control of the excitatory as well as inhibitory Ia actions to motoneurones. The recurrent inhibition may limit the Ia effects to excitation of homonymous motoneurones, which would provide optimal conditions for control of individual muscles via the γ-loop.},

	abstract = {1. The output from Renshaw cells caused by a phasic motor volley was investigated when these neurones were submitted to a background firing secondary to a tonic motor discharge elicited by a repetitive stimulation of muscle group I afferents. It was invariably found in individual Renshaw cells that tonic excitation produced an increase in the additional ouput caused by the phasic motor volley. The curves displaying this increase exhibited a significant 'jump' when the output resulting from the combined tonic and phasic motor discharges ranged between 2 and 5 spikes during the first 10 msec following the phasic volley. 2. The whole pool of Renshaw cells was also considered by assessing the amount of recurrent inhibition in motoneurones following a phasic motor volley. Similarly it was found that additional recurrent inhibition elicited by a phasic motor volley was enhanced when the Renshaw cells received a tonic excitatory input. 3. The Renshaw cell discharges elicited by stimulation of two different nerves were compared when a conditioning stimulus was previously applied to only one of them. The results strongly suggest that a preceding volley caused a decrease in synaptic efficacy at the terminals of the recurrent collaterals. 4. The firing produced by current injected through the recording micro-electrode was investigated in one intracellularly recorded Renshaw cell. It was found that the current-frequency curve was linear for 'steady-state' firing but displayed a clearcut sigmoid shape for the earliest intervals before the final adaptation. 5. It is demonstrated that this sigmoid input-output relation in individual Renshaw cells is sufficient to explain how the controls acting on these neurones may change the gain in the recurrent pathway when Renshaw cells are fired by a phasic motor discharge. When Renshaw cells are fired by a longlasting tonic motor discharge the linear input-output relation in individual cells should not cause any modifications of the gain in the recurrent pathway. A change in this gain secondary to the effects of segmental and supraspinal control systems is, however, possible if the motor discharge creates a subliminal fringe within the pool of Renshaw cells.},

It is, however, difficult to interpret these results in terms of excitation contributed by slow and fast motor units because of the following reasons. First, the size of the MSR recorded in ventral roots is not linearly related to the number of recruited motor units, since larger motor axons contribute more to the size of the MSR than smaller ones. Second, the number of spikes evoked in a Renshaw cell burst is not linearly related to the excitatory input because Renshaw cell discharge saturates in the case of large responses. The contribution of small, early-recruited motoneurones to Renshaw cell excitation is consequently overestimated. Procedures were introduced to deal with these problems. It is concluded that the last-recruited motor units (probably 'fast twitch, fast fatiguing') on average contribute four times as much excitation to Renshaw cells as the first recruited ('slow twitch') motor units.},

Maximal homonymous recurrent IPSP (RIPSP) and input resistance (RN) were measured at 'resting' membrane potential and close to firing threshold. The 'synaptic current' at the peak of the RIPSP was estimated (RIPSP/RN). At 'resting' membrane potential the RIPSPs increased in the order FF less than FR less than S (0.9, 1.4, and 2.5 mV, respectively). This order was preserved when the 'current' (RIPSP/RN) rather than voltage was considered, although the overall range was much reduced. When investigated close to firing threshold there were no significant differences in synaptic 'current'. This apparent paradox may be explained by systematic differences in firing threshold between motor unit types; it increased in the order S less than FR less than FF (4.6, 8.9 and 13.5 mV, respectively).},

	abstract = {This book presents a summary of knowledge concerning somatic motoneurones, the cells which link the central nervous system to the skeletal muscles. There are two functional kinds of such motoneurones: the alpha motoneurones innervating skeletal muscle fibres and the smaller gamma motoneurones which exclusively innervate muscle fibres of complex intramuscular sense organs, the muscle spindles. This book deals primarily with the alpha motoneurones, which together constitute the main output interface of the central nervous system and without which no muscle action is possible. The study of motoneurones is important for general insights as to how neurones work, because the alpha motoneurone is probably the best understood kind of nerve cell so far in neuroscience. Motoneurones of the spinal cord were the first type of central nerve cell to be subjected to detailed physiological measurements, and much is known about how their activity is regulated by synapses from other neurones. For most of the individual neurones within the central nervous system, the precise functional tasks are difficult to define. However, for alpha motoneurones much is known about their short- and long-term interactions with their main targets, the skeletal muscle fibres. Functions of neurones must be analyzed in relation to the response properties of their target cells. Therefore, this book deals with both, summarizing classical as well as recent knowledge concerning motoneurones and their muscle fibres (i.e., motor units).},

	abstract = {1. Steady-state recurrent (Renshaw) inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (RIPSPs) were evoked in cat triceps surae motoneurons by stimulating the heteronymous muscle nerve at 100 Hz after dorsal root section. The effective synaptic currents (i.e., the net synaptic current measured at the soma, IN) underlying these inhibitory potentials were measured with a modified voltage-clamp technique. 2. The average value of the effective synaptic currents measured in medial gastrocnemius (MG) motoneurons was 0.4 nA. There was no significant correlation between the IN measured in individual cells and motoneuron input resistance (RN), rheobase (IR), duration of the spike afterhyperpolarization (AHPt1/2), or putative motor-unit type, although the steady-state inhibitory post-synaptic potential (IPSP) amplitudes were correlated with all of these parameters. 3. Steady-state recurrent inhibition was accompanied by a small (3.5\%, on average) decrease in the resting input resistance of the motoneurons. The small magnitude of this measured change supports the hypothesis of Burke et al. that the site of synaptic contact between Renshaw cells and motoneurons is somewhat distal to the cell soma. 4. The absence of a differential distribution of the effective synaptic currents generated by Renshaw cells within the MG pool does not support the idea that recurrent inhibition mediates a selective reduction of the firing of small, low-threshold motoneurons by large, high-threshold motoneurons. The small amplitude of the effective synaptic currents we measured suggests that the contribution of recurrent inhibition to the direct modulation of motoneuron firing rate is subtle and that it is perhaps principally involved in the fine control and smooth production of muscle force.},

Motoneuron impedance was determined by injecting quasi-white noise current into lumbosacral motoneurons of pentobarbital-anesthetized cats. Synaptic location and conductance were estimated by comparing observed impedance changes to simulation results obtained using standard motoneuron models and compartmental models fit to each impedance function. Estimated synaptic locations ranged from 0.10 to 0.41λ, with a mean of 0.19 or 0.24λ, depending on the estimation method. Average dendritic path length was 262 μm. Average synaptic conductance was 23 to 27 nS (range: 6.7 to 57.9 nS), corresponding to conductance changes of 78 to 88\% of resting membrane conductance. Estimated accuracy was supported by consistency using different estimation methods, agreement with Fyffe's 1991 morphological data, and comparisons of observed and simulated recurrent IPSP amplitudes. Synaptic location, but not synaptic conductance, was correlated with rheobase, a measure of motoneuron excitability. Synaptic conductance did not depend on synaptic location. A regression analysis demonstrated that synaptic conductance and cell impedance were the principal factors determining recurrent IPSP amplitude. Simulations using the observed values and locations of Renshaw conductance demonstrate that recurrent inhibition can require as much as an additional 14 to 18\% sustained excitatory synaptic conductance to depolarize motoneurons sufficiently to activate somatic or dendritic inward currents and recruit motoneurons or amplify excitatory synaptic currents.},

	abstract = {1. The amplitude of recurrent inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (RIPSPs) was examined in pairs of lumbosacral motoneurons that were separated by a known distance and were identified by antidromic stimulation of muscle nerves. One motoneuron was stimulated by injecting depolarizing current pulses, and postsynaptic responses were recorded and averaged in the second motoneuron. Input resistance, rheobase, and conduction velocity were determined for many motoneurons. Most motoneurons innervated extensor muscles. 2. RIPSP values as large as -283 microV were recorded, but most were between -10 and -40 microV. RIPSPs from individual motoneurons of a pool are distributed to several heteronymous motor nuclei and have a range of amplitudes comparable with homonymous RIPSPs. 3. A specific spatial distribution of RIPSP amplitudes was found whereby the largest RIPSP amplitudes ({\textgreater} 40 microV) occurred in motoneurons located within +/- 1.4 mm of the stimulated motoneuron. A significant correlation was found between RIPSP amplitude and the distance between motoneurons for all motoneuron pairs. This correlation was also found within individual groups of motoneuron pairs that innervate the lateral gastrocnemius, medial gastrocnemius, anterior-middle biceps femoris, or soleus muscles. 4. The dependency of RIPSP amplitude on the motoneuron species, which is the particular muscle a motoneuron innervates, is less distinct than the dependency of RIPSP amplitude on topography. Pooling all motoneuron species of close motoneuron pairs indicated that RIPSPs measured in homonymous motoneuron pairs were greater in amplitude than RIPSPs measured in heteronymous pairs. In addition, homonymous RIPSPs of anterior middle biceps femoris or lateral gastrocnemius motoneurons were greater than heteronymous RIPSPs of those motoneurons in all heteronymous combinations. However, homonymous and heteronymous RIPSPs were not significantly different when heteronymous pairs were restricted to individual combinations of species. These findings indicate that RIPSP amplitudes within a set of motor nuclei interconnected by recurrent inhibition are dependent in some cases on the species of motoneurons, but this effect is less important than the effect of topography on RIPSP amplitude. 5. These results indicate that recurrent inhibition in motoneuron pools that innervate hindlimb extensor muscles has a strong topographic organization, such that the strongest recurrent inhibition is produced by each motoneuron in a restricted rostrocaudal zone that includes both homonymous and heteronymous motor nuclei. This suggests that recurrent inhibition is organized for the control of several motor nuclei engaged in common motor activity as well as regulation of activity within individual motor pools.},

	abstract = {1. The contraction of limb extensor muscles during side-down roll tilt of the animal depends upon an increased discharge of excitatory vestibulospinal (VS) neurons (α-response) and a reduced discharge of inhibitory reticulospinal (RS) neurons of the medulla (β-response), both acting on ipsilateral limb extensor motoneurons. In the decerebrate cat, a modulation of the multiunit EMG activity was clearly present in forelimb extensors, but was extremely weak or absent in hindlimb extensors. 2. Experiments performed in decerebrate cats with the deefferented GS muscle fixed at a constant length have shown that Renshaw (R)-cells, monosynaptically coupled with gastrocnemius-soleus (GS) motoneurons, were either unresponsive or displayed only very weak, small amplitude α-responses to sinusoidal stimulation of labyrinth receptors elicited during slow head rotation after bilateral neck deafferentation. This effect was attributed to excitatory VS volleys acting on GS motoneurons and, through their recurrent collaterals, on the related R-cells. In these instances the recurrent inhibition of the GS motoneurons contributed to the very low gain of the EMG response of the corresponding muscles to labyrinth stimulation. 3. Intravenous injection of an anticholinesterase (eserine sulphate, 0.05–0.1 mg/kg) at a dose that in previous experiments increased the firing rate of medullary RS neurons, while decreasing the decerebrate rigidity, slightly increased the discharge rate of R-cells linked with the GS motoneurons in the animal at rest; these findings suggest that the RS system inhibits the extensor motoneurons by exciting the related R-cells. All the R-cells, which prior to the injection were either unresponsive or showed an α-response to head rotation (at 0.026–0.15 Hz, ±10°), after eserine sulphate showed a β-response for the same parameters of labyrinth stimulation. In particular, a reduced discharge of the R-cells linked with the GS motoneurons occurred during side-down head rotation as shown for the majority of the RS neurons. It appears therefore that the same R-cells, which in the normal decerebrate cat responded to the excitatory VS volleys acting through the GS motoneurons, were now decoupled from their input motoneurons during head rotation, thus behaving as if they underwent the most efficient direct excitatory control of the RS system. The reduced discharge of the R-cells linked with the GS motoneurons during side-down head rotation would lead to disinhibition of these motoneurons, thus enhancing the response gain of the corresponding muscle to labyrinth stimulation. 4. This hypothesis was supported by the results of electromyographic experiments showing that the modulation of the multiunit activity of the GS muscle, which in normal decerebrate cats was negligible or extremely poor in amplitude, greatly increased after injection of the same dose of anticholinesterase. 5. We postulate that the inhibitory RS system, which is under the tonic excitatory control of a cholinergic system, operates through the R-cells as a variable gain regulator, acting at the motoneuronal level during the vestibular reflexes. The results of the present experiments support the general hypothesis on the function recently attributed to the recurrent inhibitory circuit in the spinal cord.},

If the following remarks venture to devise for reflex inhibition yet another schema additional to the several existent, they do so with full recognition of the value and service of schemes already (4, 13, 14, 17, 22, 42) in the field. A complex problem, however, may be helped by offer of alternative suggestions. Dealing with the well-known schema originating from Keith Lucas (42), and developed with such notable advantage to the subject by Adrian and Forbes, Adrian himself has very recently (4) summarised the present position of the problem and main views obtaining on it. Here, therefore, it may be permitted to proceed without further preface to the scheme which it is sought to offer for consideration.},

To understand how such a complex system functions requires the construction and analysis of computational models at many different levels. This book provides a step-by-step account of how to model the neuron and neural circuitry to understand the nervous system at all levels, from ion channels to networks. Starting with a simple model of the neuron as an electrical circuit, gradually more details are added to include the effects of neuronal morphology, synapses, ion channels and intracellular signaling. The principle of abstraction is explained through chapters on simplifying models, and how simplified models can be used in networks. This theme is continued in a final chapter on modeling the development of the nervous system. Requiring an elementary background in neuroscience and some high school mathematics, this textbook is an ideal basis for a course on computational neuroscience.},

	abstract = {.Recurrent inhibition in the mammalian spinal cord is complex, and its functions are not yet well understood. Skeletomotoneurons (α-MNs) excite, via recurrent axon collaterals, inhibitory Renshaw cells (RCs), which in turn inhibit α-MNs and other neurons. The anatomical and functional structure of the recurrent inhibitory network is nonhomogeneous, and the gain and filtering characteristics of RCs are modulated by inputs circumventing α-MNs. This complex organization is likely to play important roles for the discharge and recruitment properties of α-MNs. Modeling this system is a way of investigating hypothesized roles for normal functioning including muscle fatigue and different forms of physiological pathological tremor. In this paper, a detailed model including α-MNs, RCs, and the muscle fibers innervated by the α-MNs is presented. Outlines of the experimental data underlying the model and the modeling philosophy and procedure are presented. Then the behavior of a RC model is compared with experimental data reported in the literature. Model and experimental data agree well for burst responses elicited by synchronous single-pulse activation of different numbers of motor axons. In addition, the static relation between motor-axon activation rate and RC firing rate agree fairly well in model and experiment, and the same applies to the dynamic responses to step changes in motor-axon rate. The ultimate objective is to use this model in probing the role of recurrent inhibition in the control and stability of (isometric) muscular force under normal and altered conditions occurring during fatigue and muscle pain.},

	abstract = {.The physiological function of spinal recurrent inhibition is still a matter of debate because of the experimental difficulty or impossibility of observing recurrent inhibition at work in normally behaving animals. The purpose of this study was to investigate, by computer simulation, the role of recurrent inhibition in shaping the input-output (I/O) relationships between descending command signals (DCS) as inputs and motoneuron (MN) and Renshaw cell (RC) firing rates and muscle force as outputs. Changing the spatial (topographical) distribution of recurrent inhibition from nonhomogeneous (as in the standard model) to homogeneous did not alter the I/O relationships significantly, while changing the functional distribution related to MN types did. Altering the global gain of recurrent inhibition, as happens naturally in various motor acts, changes the slopes and positions (at high inputs) of the I/O relationships, making recurrent inhibition a suitable means of gain control. Coupling a decrease in recurrent inhibitory gain with an increase in DCS input, as could occur during slow dynamic contractions, would increase the MN and force gains during the act. Short dynamic ramp-and-hold DCS inputs generate MN firing patterns, to which recurrent inhibition contributes interspike-interval variability and damped oscillations, which are related to issues of tremor and its control.},

Unidirectional interactions were also seen: in two cases motoneurones excited Renshaw cells from which they received no inhibition, and in 7 cases Renshaw cells caused hyperpolarizing potential changes in motoneurones from which they received no excitation.

Large-scale computational models of a motoneuron pool and the muscle it innervates have been used as tools to advance the knowledge of how neural elements may influence force control. Here, we present a frequency domain analysis of a NARX model fitted to a large-scale neuromuscular model by the means of generalized frequency response functions (GFRF). The results of such procedures indicated that the computational neuromuscular model was capable of transforming an oscillatory synaptic input (e.g., at 20 Hz) into a constant mean muscle force output. The nonlinearity uncovered by the GFRFs of the NARX model was responsible for the demodulation of an oscillatory input (e.g., a beta band oscillation coming from the brain and forming the input to the motoneuron pool). This suggests a manner by which brain rhythms descending as command signals to the spinal cord and acting on a motoneuron pool can regulate a maintained muscle force. In addition to the scientific aspects of these results, they provide new interpretations that may further neural engineering applications associated with quantitative neurological diagnoses and robotic systems for artificial limbs.},

The size of the cell bodies of the motoneurones, and the diameters of their intramedullary axons, were related to their axonal conduction velocities over the whole range studied. 3. Despite the smaller size of the cell bodies of the γ-motoneurones, their dendritic trees extended as far as those of the α-motoneurones. However, γ-motoneurones had fewer main dendrites than the α-motoneurones and these branched much less, so that the dendritic trees of the γ-motoneurones were much simpler than those of α-motoneurones. Although the extents of the dendritic trees were not related to axonal conduction velocity, the complexity of the dendritic trees was clearly related to axonal conduction velocity and to cell body size. 4. The total surface area of each cell, taken as an indication of the area available for synaptic contact, was much smaller for γ- than for α-motoneurones, and was related to axonal conduction velocity. 5. Only one of the seven γ-motoneurones studied had axon collaterals whereas five of the nine α-motoneurones had well developed collaterals. This finding is consistent with the relative contribution that each group of motoneurone axons makes to recurrent inhibition. 6. One of the γ-motoneurones had two axons, of different diameter, which emerged from the spinal cord at the same level but in different ventral rootlets. 7. These features of motoneurone structure are related to aspects of their physiological properties.},
